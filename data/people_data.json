      "biography": "An actor by trade but also a filmmaker, musician, and photographer, Adam Goldberg's career has spanned more than three decades comprising a vast resume of eclectic work both on off the screen. From mining the neuroses of characters for both dramatic and comedic effect, to producing work as a filmmaker with a superlative eye and keen wit, Goldberg has solidified his standing as a unique and prolific presence in the entertainment industry. Goldberg is a co-star on the hit CBS series \"The Equalizer.\" The show, a re imagining of the classic series and films, follows Robyn McCall (Queen Latifah), an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn. Goldberg is a standout as whip smart, sardonic, and surprisingly fashion conscious computer hacker Harry Keshegian, who is like a brother to McCall and a fiercely supportive husband to his sniper wife Mel (Liza Lapira). \"The Equalizer\" had a massive debut to over 23 million viewers in 2021 and is currently airing its third season. Brand new episodes will return February 19, 2023, on CBS. Also in television, Goldberg gained critical acclaim and fostered in a new generation of fans as Mr. Numbers in the award-winning crime drama \"Fargo\" (FX). He starred opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Colin Hanks on the show, which was inspired by the 1996 film of the same name. Goldberg is also known for his tour de force arcs as Crazy Eddie on \"Friends\" (NBC) and Nicky Rubinstein on \"Entourage\" (HBO), as well as starring roles on \"The Jim Gaffigan Show,\" \"Taken\" (NBC),(NBC), \"The Unusuals\" (ABC), \"NYC 22\" (CBS), \"The $treet\" (FOX), and \"God Friended Me\" (CBS). Often recognized for his impressive body of work in film, Goldberg has been hand-picked by Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard for memorable roles in their Academy Award winning projects. A career-changing moment for Goldberg was landing the role of tough, wise-cracking infantryman Private Mellish in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" opposite Tom Hanks. The film went on to receive 5 Academy Awards while also being nominated for Best Picture. From there, he starred in major blockbusters including Academy Award winner \"A Beautiful Mind\" which marked his second collaboration with director Ron Howard. In 2003 he showcased his talent in comedy, appearing a third time opposite Matthew McConaughey, in \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\" Other seminal performances include playing Christopher Walken's undead and unwitting assistant, Jerry, in Gregrory Widen's cult thriller \"The Prophecy,\" Michael Rapaport's beleaguered roommate in John Singleton's \"Higher Learning,\" appearing in Ron Howard's \"EdTV,\" and portraying a speed freak opposite Val Kilmer and Peter Sarsgaard in DJ Caruso's debut \"The Salton Sea.\" Additional recent work includes starring opposite Bruce Willis and John Goodman in \"Once Upon a Time in Venice,\" and appearing alongside Nicholas Cage and Laurence Fishburne in \"Running with the Devil.\" A filmmaker's actor, Goldberg also appeared, notably, in Tony Scott's \"Déjà Vu\" opposite Denzel Washington, and in David Fincher's \"Zodiac.\" Goldberg is known for effortlessly jumping back and forth between mainstream film and television roles with acclaimed passion projects. Namely, the titular role in Jonathan Kesselman's 'Jewxploitation' comedy, \"The Hebrew Hammer,\" his hilarious collaboration with Julie Delpy in \"2 Days in Paris,\" and his portrayal of a brilliant but eccentric musician in the art world satire \"(Untitled)\" opposite Marley Shelton. Other standouts include his turn as a performance artist opposite Olivia Thirlby in Rafael Palacio Illingworth's \"Between Us,\" and a cult leader who indoctrinates Fran Kranz in the Netflix thriller \"Rebirth,\" both of which premiered the same year at the Tribeca Film Festival. Born in Santa Monica and raised in LA, Goldberg loved to perform and create from an early age, taking acting classes and studying film and photography since secondary school. His debut in the entertainment industry came with supporting film role in Billy Crystal's \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" but it was his turn as Mike, an intellectual with a chip on his shoulder, in Richard Linklater's iconic, '70s coming of age classic \"Dazed and Confused\" that introduced Goldberg to an audience that continues to grow as the film captivates new audiences with each generation. Linklater would later make a cameo in Goldberg's directorial debut, \"Scotch and Milk,\" and later host a screening at Austin's Alamo Draft House the same summer Goldberg appeared in Linklater's groundbreaking, psychedelic animation feature, \"Waking Life.\" Goldberg wrote, directed, starred in, and co-edited \"Scotch and Milk\" when he was just 24 years old. The stylized black and white film follows a group of young jazz obsessed hipsters trying to reconcile their machismo with their sensitivity. Additionally, Goldberg screened a rough cut for Spielberg during the making of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" which led Spielberg to enlist his post production supervisor to help finish the film. \"Scotch and Milk\" debuted at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival and earned critical acclaim on the festival circuit. This included a particular notable write up in American Cinematography Magazine and featured on the Sundance Channel series \"10 Best Films You May Have Never Seen.\" Goldberg would go on to co-write the psychological drama \"I Love Your Work,\" starring frequent collaborator Giovanni Ribisi, and featuring Franka Potente, Christina Ricci, and Joshua Jackson. The film follows an actor whose life goes south after he forms an obsession with a young film student. Goldberg composed and arranged music for the film alongside The Flaming Lips' multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd, and it debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival where the film was picked up for theatrical distribution. He also directed, co-edited, and produced the surreal documentary short \"Running with the Bulls\" for the Independent Film Channel, and most recently co-wrote, directed, edited, and starred in the Sony feature film \"No Way Jose,\" in which he plays a washed-up indie rocker going through a midlife crisis. While working in film and television has been a huge part of Goldberg's life, his passion for photography and music have garnered their own cult following over the years, establishing him something of a modern day renaissance man. As a musician, Goldberg has recorded four albums under his moniker The Goldberg Sisters - two of which he recorded with a an eclectic array of musicians, and the last two of which he recorded in his home studio playing every instrument. As part of his 2018, 14-track album entitled \"HOME: A Nice Place to Visit\" Goldberg released a limited edition vinyl set that included a stunning large-format photo book, marrying his love for soundscapes and photography. Goldberg also directed the accompanying videos. Show Gallery in Los Angeles hosted an exhibition of the work where Goldberg played some of the tracks from the record utilizing loop pedals and other effects. The Goldberg Sisters discography also includes: Stranger's Morning (2013), The Goldberg Sisters (2011), and Landy (2009). https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-goldberg-sisters/422885644 As a photographer Goldberg's signature dreamy, double exposures shot on film document and explore people, landscapes, and create cinematic scenes from which viewers can draw their own interpretations. Goldberg is also known for his style and passion for fashion, which he attributes to his mom with whom he used to go vintage clothes shopping on Melrose in the '80s. Any follower of his Instagram will take note of his extensive tagging of small brands, bespoke makers, and his support of slow fashion writ large. Everything he wears on \"The Equalizer\" - clothes and accessories - are either straight out of Goldberg's closet (a dedicated room in his house, he's not proud of this, nor is his wife thrilled) or handpicked by the actor. Goldberg currently divides his time between Los Angeles and New York with his wife and two sons. ### - IMDb mini biography by: his publicist.",

      "biography": "English film actor, director and author Andy Serkis is known for his performance capture roles comprising motion capture acting, animation and voice work for such computer-generated characters as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001-2003) and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) , the eponymous King Kong in the 2005 film, Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) , Captain Haddock / Sir Francis Haddock in Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) . Serkis earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film Longford (2006) , and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll (2010) . In 2015, he had a small role in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) . Serkis has his own motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium Studios in London, which he will use for his directorial debut, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (2018) . Andrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was Serkissian, was a medical doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent time around the Middle East, and for the first ten years of his life, Andy traveled between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes. He attended St. Benedict's School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe 's play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life. Instead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare 's \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s. In 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson 's epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien 's saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) , which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team's effort around Serkis's work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis's work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production. Serkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin , which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum's physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he'd go the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in King Kong (2005) , which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture. Apart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 (2004) , and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in The Prestige (2006) , among other film performances. On television, he starred as 'Vincent Van Gogh' in the sixth episode of Power of Art (2006) , the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Inkheart (2008) . At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007) , a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project. Andy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne , and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (born on 19 June 2004), who is now also a movie star. Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is a pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London. Andy Serkis lives with his family in North London, England. - IMDb mini biography by: Steve Shelokhonov and Pedro Borges",

      "biography": "An actress on both stage and screen, Anna Gunn has portrayed a vast array of complex and powerful characters throughout her career. Anna grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico after her parents, Sharon (Peters) and Clemens Gunn, Jr., transplanted the family from Cleveland, Ohio to the Southwest in the late seventies. She discovered acting in a drama class at the Santa Fe Preparatory School and was fortunate to study with two formidable teachers from the Actor's Studio as a teenager. She continued her education and training at Northwestern University's renowned theatre department, winning a coveted scholarship award in her junior year. During her time at Northwestern, Anna went abroad for a semester to study with the British American Drama Academy and had the marvelous opportunity to perform in the school's final project at the famed Royal Court Theatre in London. Anna has moved between television, film, and theatre with much ease. In 2004, Anna landed her breakout television role, playing Martha Bullock on HBO's seminal show, Deadwood (2004) and later received a SAG nomination for Best Ensemble Cast in 2006. Anna's association with Deadwood (2004) creator David Milch began early on when she first worked with him on his hit drama NYPD Blue (1993) , giving a memorable performance as Kimmy, a junkie longing to escape New York to swim with the dolphins. Anna made such an indelible impression on Milch, that almost nine years later she became the template for the pivotal and complex character of Martha. Another major recurring role for Anna was on David E. Kelley 's The Practice (1997) , delivering a notable turn as ADA Jean Ward opposite Dylan McDermott and Lara Flynn Boyle . Her extensive television credits also include starring roles in several made for TV movies and major guest starring appearances on such shows as Six Feet Under (2001) , ER (1994) , Boston Legal (2004) , Law & Order (1990) and Seinfeld (1989) .

Her upcoming films include Little Red Wagon (2012) and Sassy Pants (2012) , for which she received a nomination at the 2012 Milan Film Festival for Best Supporting Actress. Anna is also a highly regarded and much sought after actress of the stage. In early 2009 she created the leading role of photojournalist Sarah Goodwin in Donald Margulies' world premiere production of Time Stands Still, directed by Daniel Sullivan at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. In 1999 she starred as Isabella in Measure for Measure at the Ahmanson Theatre helmed by the famed director Sir Peter Hall. In 1997, Anna was brought east to make her Broadway debut alongside Roger Rees in The Rehearsal at the Roundabout Theater.

      "biography": "Barry Robert Pepper was born on April 4, 1970, in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. He has two older brothers named Alex and Doug Pepper. The Peppers didn't stick around Campbell River for too long. They had been building a ship in their backyard for years. When Barry was five years old, the ship was done and the family set sail. The ship, named \"The Moonlighter,\" was a 50-foot craft that would be their home for the next five years. They navigated through the South Pacific islands, using only a sextant and the stars as guides. While visiting such exotic locales as Fiji and Tahiti, Barry was educated through correspondence courses and sometimes enrolled in public schools. He grew up around Polynesian children and credits them for his love of dance, music and other expressive arts. Barry had plenty of time to practice his newfound loves, too. Without television as entertainment on the ship, the family relied on games and sketch acting for fun. When the five-year cruise was over, the Peppers returned to their native Canada, where they set up shop on a small island off the West Coast near Vancouver. They built a farm on the outskirts of a small artists' town, which was populated mainly by hippies, poets, musicians and other craftsmen. While in high school, Barry was enthusiastic about art and excelled in sports. In addition to playing volleyball, he was an excellent rugby player. He graduated in 1988 from George P. Vanier High School in Courtenay and then enrolled in college and majored in marketing and graphic design, but after getting involved with the Vancouver Actors Studio, he changed his course. Once again, he was using \"the stars\" to navigate. Barry landed his first role on Madison (1993) (a sort of Canadian 90210) and other prominent television series before moving on to more prestigious roles in the US. Television movies followed, most notably the mini-series Titanic (1996) , which costarred George C. Scott . Still, Barry's career really wasn't taking off. He was a hard-working actor, but not a star. That all changed in 1998. After a string of big screen duds, Pepper obtained his breakthrough role as a Bible-quoting sniper in Steven Spielberg 's WW II drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) . With the success of the film came sudden stardom for its cast--complete with photo spreads, interviews and even some Oscar buzz. Barry followed the film with a small but noteworthy role in the blockbuster, Enemy of the State (1998) opposite Will Smith and Gene Hackman . Next he co-starred in an Oscar-worthy film starring Tom Hanks : Stephen King 's The Green Mile (1999) . Barry received much critical acclaim in 2001 for his portrayal of Roger Maris in the made-for-cable drama about the 1961 home run race between Maris and Mickey Mantle called 61* (2001) . - IMDb mini biography by: Laffz00@aol.com",

      "biography": "Baz Luhrmann is an Australian writer, director and producer with projects spanning film, television, opera, theater, music and recording industries. He is regarded by many as a contemporary example of an auteur for his distinctly recognizable style and deep involvement in the writing, directing, design and musical components of all his work. As a storyteller, he's known as a pioneer of pop culture, fusing high and low culture with a unique sonic and cinematic language. He is the most commercially successful Australian director, with his films making up four of the top ten highest worldwide grossing Australian films ever. During his studies at Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art, Luhrmann collaborated with other students to create ''Strictly ballroom'', a stage production drawn from his childhood experiences in the world of ballroom dancing. Luhrmann later adapted the show into his 1992 film debut, Strictly Ballroom (1992) , which premiered at Cannes to a fifteen-minute standing ovation. Thus began the ''Red Curtain Trilogy'', which would include the film Romeo + Juliet (1996) as well as the Oscar-winning Moulin Rouge! (2001) . The latter also took home Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Score. This first body of work was capped by Luhrmann's 2002 Broadway adaptation of the opera ''La Bohème'', recognized by two Tony Awards. In 2004, Luhrmann collaborated once more with actress Nicole Kidman to create No. 5 The Film, a short film featuring the iconic Chanel perfume, as well as costumes designed by Karl Lagerfeld. With its success, the piece ushered in a new era of fashion advertising and became a landmark in the evolution of branded content. In 2008, Luhrmann worked with Kidman for a third time on the ambitious epic Australia (2008) , the titular country's second-highest grossing film of all time. He later adapted F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''The Great Gatsby'' into a 2013 film, The Great Gatsby (2013) , which went on to become the director's highest-grossing movie at over $353 million worldwide. The film was awarded with two Oscars and earned praise from Fitzgerald's granddaughter, who noted that \"Scott would have been proud\". The film's soundtrack pulled the Roaring 20s into the 2000s, blending early 20th century jazz with contemporary hip-hop. The album, produced by Luhrmann, Anton Monsted , and Jay-Z , hit number one on the Billboard charts and garnered several Grammy nominations. Most recently, Luhrmann created The Get Down (2016) , a 2016 Netflix series and 1970s-set mythic saga of how the South Bronx, at the brink of bankruptcy, gave birth to hip-hop, punk and disco. In the interest of cultural authenticity and historical accuracy Luhrmann collaborated with some of the era's most legendary artists, including Grandmaster Flash , Kool Herc , Afrika Bambaataa , Nas , Kurtis Blow , and Hector Xtravaganza . The show was a critical success, certified fresh by Rotten Tomatoes, and described by Variety as \"a reclamation of, and a love letter to, a marginalized community of a certain era, told through the unreliable tools of romance, intuition and lived experiences.\" Add further information about Elvis film release here.

Kingsley first earned international fame for his performance in the drama movie Gandhi (1982) . His performance as Mohandas K. Gandhi earned him international fame. He won many awards - including an Academy Award for Best Actor. He also won Golden Globe, BAFTA and London Film Critics' Circle Awards. After acting in Gandhi (1982) , Ben was recognized as one of the finest British actors. After his international fame for appearing in Gandhi (1982) , Kingsley appeared in many other famous movies. His success as an actor continued. His performance as Itzhak Stern in the drama movie Schindler's List (1993) earned him a BAFTA nomination for best supporting actor. Schindler's List (1993) won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. During the late 1990s, Kingsley acted in many successful movies. He played Sweeney Todd in the television movie The Tale of Sweeney Todd (1997) , for which he was nominated for the Screen Actors' Guild Award. His other notable role was as Otto Frank in the television movie Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001) , for which he won the Screen Actors' Guild Award. In 2002, Kingsley was appointed Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's New Years Honours for his services to drama.

      "biography": "Halfway through a PhD in physics at Cambridge University, Ben met Alexander Armstrong (who was also\nstudying there) in 1992. Instead of finishing his PhD, Ben chose to\nscrap science for comedy and started playing at the Comedy Club\nFootlights, Cambridge. After four years of touring pubs and underground\ncomedy clubs, the pair appeared on 'Saturday Live' as (now one of\ntheir most well-known sketches) Euro-Rock duo 'Strijka.' The year 1996\nsaw the pair nominated for the Perrier Award and were given their first\ncommissioned series, Armstrong and Miller (1997) .\nBroadcast first on the Paramount Channel, which was then followed by\nthree further series shown on Channel Four (1997, 1999 & 2001). Ben and\nAlexander took \"The Armstrong and Miller Show\" on tour in November 2001\nand did a 17-day back-to-back stint. The success of \"Armstrong and\nMiller\"\n(1997)_ gave Ben a springboard to work on other projects. _Passion Killers (1999)_\nand The Blind Date (2000) are just\ntwo of the television films that enabled Ben to go more mainstream and\nshow that he is capable of straight acting as well as his cheeky-chappy\nside shown in Armstrong and Miller (1997) .\nBen is not shy of the big screen either. August 2001 saw the release of Steve Coogan 's: The Parole Officer (2001) , in\nwhich Ben played small-time criminal Colin; in 1999, he starred\nalongside Ray Winstone and Robert Carlyle in the comedy\ndrama_ There's Only One Jimmy Grimble (2000)_. Most people may not\nrecognize Ben as the voice of ITV's Digital Monkey that stars alongside\nfellow comedian Johnny Vegas in the infamous adverts, which has led to\na wad of merchandise and a string of 15-minute programs yet to be\nshown. March 2002 saw Ben as a snotty hotel concierge in Jez Butterworth 's film Birthday Girl (2001) . With further\nfuture projects lined up for 2002 (including a six-part series called The Book Group (2002) , to be\nshown later on), only time will tell if the 35-year-old will remain\nunderground or leap out into the mainstream audience. Since 2003, Ben has continued his successful solo and comedy career. He\nplayed Rowan Atkinson 's sidekick Bough in\nthe 2003's blockbuster Johnny English (2003) . He went to\nCanada to film The Prince and Me (2004) .\nMainstream audiences started to take notice in 2005, when The Worst Week of My Life (2004) aired in BBC1. It was so successful that a second series was\ncommissioned for the following year. In 2006, the BBC wanted a pilot\ncomedy show from Ben and Alexander - they hadn't made a show together\nsince Armstrong and Miller (1997) (4th series) which aired in 2001. This pilot led to The Armstrong and Miller Show (2007) not only coming back to television but to a more mainstream audience -\nbeing shown on BBC1 on Friday nights in 2007. After 14 years on the\ncomedy circuit, the pair were finally rewarded with a BAFTA for best\ncomedy program in 2010. Four series later, the duo decided to tour the\nUK again and played 62 shows up and down the country between September\nand November 2010. Summer of 2011: He released his directorial debut film Huge (2010) . Winter of 2011 saw Ben in the Caribbean for the BBC's Death in Paradise (2011) . His first book, \"It's Not Rocket Science,\" is being released in summer\n2012. Ben was in the theater production of \"The Ladykillers\" in the West End. - IMDb mini biography by: jas",

      "biography": "Billy Boyd was born in 1968 in Glasgow, Scotland, to Mary and William\nBoyd. The talented young boy, inspired by Star Wars to try acting, got\nhis first taste of it in his school's production of Oliver Twist when\nhe was 10. Boyd's parents were extremely supportive, driving over two\nhours to get him to the performances, but sadly they passed away when\nhe was 12. He was thereafter raised by his grandmother. He realized\nthat he enjoyed acting very much and told his school counselor that was\nwhat he wanted to be, but the counselor discouraged this choice and\ntold him to \"keep it secret\". When he was 17 he left school and went to\nwork in a book-binding workshop. He worked there 4 years as an\napprentice and 2 years as a workman. Ironically, during the years he\nworked at the book-binders, the Lord of the Rings trilogy was printed\nand bound there, many copies bound by his hands. After the 6 years as a\nbook-binder, he was thoroughly sick of it. Billy planned on going to\nAmerica for a year, but before he went he called the Royal Scottish\nAcademy of Music and Drama and asked about applying for when he got\nback. But it so happened that they still had space for that year and\nthey asked him if he wanted to apply and he did. He was at the drama\nschool in a 3-year course for his bachelor of arts degree, meanwhile\nstudying everything from Shakespeare to puppet-making. During this time\nBilly had a few small roles in TV series such as \"Down Amongst The\nBoys\" and \"Taggart\". After graduating he performed in many plays like\n'The Slab Boys', 'The Diary of Adrian Mole' etc. at The St. Andrews\ntheatre which were his first paying roles. He then received a call from\nhis agent about the Lord of the Rings movies and if he would like to\naudition for them. He went along not expecting much, but within a few\nmonths Peter Jackson came out to Scotland to meet him and to audition\nhim personally. While rehearsing for a show he received a call from his\nagent who said that the part of Pippin had been offered to him - if he\nwanted it. The rest is history. - IMDb mini biography by: basketball_bub@yahoo.com",

      "biography": "Bolaji Badejo was a graphic designer from Lagos. He is primarily remembered for his single acting role, playing the titular predatory alien in the science fiction-horror film Alien (1979) .The film was a box-office hit, having earned a worldwide gross of US$143 million by 1992 estimates. In 1953, Badejo was born in Lagos, Colonial Nigeria. At the time, Nigeria was a British colony. Badejo's family was of Yoruba descent, an ethnic group estimated to represent about 16% of the country 's population. Badejo's father would later serve as the director-general of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation, a state-owned radio-broadcasting organization. Badejo decided to follow a career as a visual artist. He studied abroad in the United States before moving to London, England, to get specialized training as a graphic designer. Bodejo was unusually tall, standing at a height of 2.08 meters (6 feet and 10 inches). Director Ridley Scott 's casting crew was seeking a tall person to play the creature in his upcoming film. They found Badejo drinking at a Soho bar and offered him the role. He accepted the offer, although he had neither acting experience nor training. In 1980, Badejo moved back to Nigeria. In 1983, Badejo opened his own art gallery. He remained active until 1992, when he died from sickle-cell anemia, a hereditary blood disorder that is very common among people of African descent. About 80% of sickle-cell disease cases recorded worldwide have occurred in Africa. Badejo was 39 years old at the time of his death. Badejo is long gone but is still fondly remembered for his only acting role. \"Alien\" has had several sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, and the influence of the original film in modern science fiction cinema is quite large. - IMDb mini biography by: Dimos I",

      "biography": "Gaunt character actor Brad Dourif was born Bradford Claude Dourif on March 18, 1950 in Huntington, West Virginia. He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother's participation as an actress in community theater. Beginning in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) . Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975) . Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman's film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award\nfor Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Skeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play\neccentric or deranged characters, starting in Eyes of Laura Mars (1978) , John Huston 's Wise Blood (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman 's Ragtime (1981) . Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Dune (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986) . His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in Child's Play (1988) and its sequels. Dourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987) , Mississippi Burning (1988) , Hidden Agenda (1990) and London Kills Me (1991) . Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976) , Dourif has made sporadic appearances on a number of television series, such as The X-Files (1993) , Babylon 5 (1993) , Star Trek: Voyager (1995) , Millennium (1996) and Ponderosa (2001) . He also appeared in the music video \"Stranger in Town\" (1984) by the rock band Toto . - IMDb mini biography by: Lyn Hammond",

      "biography": "Brent Spiner, whose primary claim to fame is his portrayal of the beloved android Data on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) ,\nwas born and raised in Houston, Texas. His parents, Sylvia (Schwartz) and Jack Spiner, owned and operated a furniture store, and were both from Jewish immigrant families (from Austria, Hungary, and Russia). Jack died of kidney failure at age 29, when Brent was 10 months old. When he was 6 years old, his mother married Sol Mintz, who adopted Brent and his older brother Ron. Although his mother divorced Mintz after 7 years of marriage, Brent retained his adopted father's last name until 1975, when he took back his birth name. Spiner first began pursuing his interest in acting while in high school. There his inspirational drama teacher, Cecil Pickett, gave a great start to the careers of a remarkable group of aspiring young actors (and directors), including Spiner, Cindy Pickett (Cecil's daughter), Randy Quaid , Dennis Quaid , Trey Wilson , Robert Wuhl and Thomas Schlamme ,\nall of whom later attained success in Hollywood. After graduation, Spiner followed his mentor to the University of Houston and other local colleges, while also launching his professional acting career in theater (The Houston Music Theater and other regional theater) and in film ( My Sweet Charlie (1970) , which was shot on location in Texas). After a couple of false starts in New York and Hollywood, Spiner eventually established himself as a stage actor in New York, appearing in a number of off-Broadway and Broadway plays, such as \"A History of the American Film\" (1978), \"Leave It to Beaver is Dead\" (1979), \"Sunday in the Park with George\" (1984), and \"Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1985). While in New York, he had a bit part in Woody Allen 's Stardust Memories (1980) and starred in an independent film called Rent Control (1981) . The play \"Little Shop of Horrors \"brought Spiner to Los Angeles in 1984, where he eventually took up permanent residence. In 1986, after a number of character parts in television series and movies, such as Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985) , Crime of Innocence (1985) , Manhunt for Claude Dallas (1986) , and Family Sins (1987) , Spiner snagged the role that would bring him international fame: Data, the endearing android, whom Spiner played \"by tapping into his inner child.\" Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) , the sequel to the original television series Star Trek (1966) , became hugely popular, moving to the big screen for four films (so far) after its 7-year run on television. Aside from these films, Spiner has made cameo appearances in a number of films directed by his friend and old schoolmate Thomas Schlamme , such as Miss Firecracker (1989) , Crazy from the Heart (1991) , and Kingfish: A Story of Huey P. Long (1995) , and has appeared in small roles in more recent films, such as Dude, Where's My Car? (2000) and The Master of Disguise (2002) . Arguably his most popular film portrayal was Dr. Brakish Okun in Independence Day (1996) , a role that elicited his unique eccentricity and sense of humor. He reprised the character in the sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) . - IMDb mini biography by: Lyn Hammond",

      "biography": "Cate Blanchett was born on May 14, 1969 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, to June (Gamble), an Australian teacher and property developer, and Robert DeWitt Blanchett, Jr., an American advertising executive, originally from Texas. She has an older brother and a younger sister. When she was ten years old, her 40-year-old father died of a sudden heart attack. Her mother never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother. Cate graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and, in a little over a year, had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Caryl Churchill 's \"Top Girls\", then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in Tim Daly 's \"Kafka Dances\", winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance. From there, Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in David Mamet 's searing polemic \"Oleanna\", also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year. She then co-starred in the ABC Television's prime time drama Heartland (1994) , again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company's production of \"Hamlet\". Other theatre credits include Helen in the Sydney Theatre Company's \"Sweet Phoebe\", Miranda in \"The Tempest\" and Rose in \"The Blind Giant is Dancing\", both for the Belvoir Street Theatre Company. In other television roles, Blanchett starred as Bianca in ABC's Bordertown (1995) , as Janie Morris in G.P. (1989) and in ABC's popular series Police Rescue (1994) . She made her feature film debut in Paradise Road (1997) . Cate married writer Andrew Upton in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set, and they didn't like each other at first. He thought she was aloof, and she thought he was arrogant, but then they connected over a poker game at a party, and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in Elizabeth (1998) for which she won numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow . 2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in Bandits (2001) , The Shipping News (2001) , Charlotte Gray (2001) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the \"Lord Of The Rings\" trilogy. She also gave birth to her first child, son Dashiell, in 2001. In 2004, she gave birth to her second son Roman. Also, in 2004, she played actress Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's film The Aviator (2004) , for which she received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. Two years later, she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for playing a teacher having an affair with an underage student in Notes on a Scandal (2006) . In 2007, she returned to the role that made her a star in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) . It earned her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. She was nominated for another Oscar that same year as Best Supporting Actress for playing Bob Dylan in I'm Not There (2007) . In 2008, she gave birth to her third child, son Ignatius. She and her husband became artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company, choosing to spend more time in Australia raising their three sons. She also purchased a multi-million dollar home in Sydney, Australia and named it Bulwarra and made extensive renovations to it. Because of her life in Australia, her film work became sporadic, until Woody Allen cast her in the title role in Blue Jasmine (2013) , which won her the Academy Award as Best Actress. She ended her job as artistic director of the Sydney Theatre Company, while her husband continued there for two more years before he too resigned. In 2015, she adopted her daughter Edith in her father's homeland of the United States. That same year, she and her husband sold their multi-million dollar home in Australia at a profit and moved to America. Reasons varied from her wanting to work more in America to wanting to familiarize herself with her late father's American heritage. She played the title role of Carol (2015) , a 1950s American housewife in a lesbian affair with a younger woman, for which she received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. While most actresses might slow down in their forties, Blanchett did the opposite by stretching her boundaries even further, such as when she played 13 different characters in Manifesto (2015) and then making her Broadway debut in 2017 in \"The Present\", which is her husband's adaptation of Chekhov's play \"Platonov\" for which she earned a Tony nomination as Best Actress in a Play. Also in 2017, she was selected for the highest honor in her birth country: the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). - IMDb mini biography by: Anonymous",

      "biography": "Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee was perhaps the only actor of his generation to have starred in so many films and cult saga. Although most notable for personifying bloodsucking vampire, Dracula, on screen, he portrayed other varied characters on screen, most of which were villains, whether it be Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) , or Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) , or as the title monster in the Hammer Horror film, The Mummy (1959) . Lee was born in 1922 in London, England, where he and his older sister Xandra were raised by their parents, Contessa Estelle Marie (Carandini di Sarzano) and Geoffrey Trollope Lee, a professional soldier, until their divorce in 1926. Later, while Lee was still a child, his mother married (and later divorced) Harcourt George St.-Croix (nicknamed Ingle), who was a banker. Lee's maternal great-grandfather was an Italian political refugee, while Lee's great-grandmother was English opera singer Marie (Burgess) Carandini. After attending Wellington College from age 14 to 17, Lee worked as an office clerk in a couple of London shipping companies until 1941 when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Following his release from military service, Lee joined the Rank Organisation in 1947, training as an actor in their \"Charm School\" and playing a number of bit parts in such films as Corridor of Mirrors (1948) . He made a brief appearance in Laurence Olivier 's Hamlet (1948) , in which his future partner-in-horror Peter Cushing also appeared. Both actors also appeared later in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their horror films together. Lee had numerous parts in film and television throughout the 1950s. He struggled initially in his new career because he was discriminated as being taller than the leading male actors of his time and being too foreign-looking. However, playing the monster in the Hammer film The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) proved to be a blessing in disguise, since the was successful, leading to him being signed on for future roles in Hammer Film Productions. Lee's association with Hammer Film Productions brought him into contact with Peter Cushing, and they became good friends. Lee and Cushing often than not played contrasting roles in Hammer films, where Cushing was the protagonist and Lee the villain, whether it be Van Helsing and Dracula respectively in Horror of Dracula (1958) , or John Banning and Kharis the Mummy respectively in The Mummy (1959) . Lee continued his role as \"Dracula\" in a number of Hammer sequels throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s. During this time, he co-starred in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959) , and made numerous appearances as Fu Manchu, most notably in the first of the series The Face of Fu Manchu (1965) , and also appeared in a number of films in Europe. With his own production company, Charlemagne Productions, Ltd., Lee made Nothing But the Night (1973) and To the Devil a Daughter (1976) . By the mid-1970s, Lee was tiring of his horror image and tried to widen his appeal by participating in several mainstream films, such as The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970) , The Three Musketeers (1973) , The Four Musketeers (1974) , and the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) . The success of these films prompted him in the late 1970s to move to Hollywood, where he remained a busy actor but made mostly unremarkable film and television appearances, and eventually moved back to England. The beginning of the new millennium relaunched his career to some degree, during which he has played Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and as Saruman the White in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lee played Count Dooku again in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) , and portrayed the father of Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp , in the Tim Burton film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) . On 16 June 2001, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his services to drama. He was created a Knight Bachelor on 13 June 2009 in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to drama and charity. In addition he was made a Commander of the Order of St John on 16 January 1997. Lee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at 8:30 am after being admitted for respiratory problems and heart failure, shortly after celebrating his 93rd birthday there. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, in order to break the news to their family. - IMDb mini biography by: Lyn Hammond and Sidhartha Shankar",

      "biography": "Distinguished character actor David Hattersley Warner was born on July 29, 1941 in Manchester, England, to Ada Doreen (Hattersley) and Herbert Simon Warner. He was born out of wedlock and raised by each of his parents, eventually settling with his itinerant father and stepmother. He only saw his mother again on her deathbed. As an only child from a dysfunctional family, young David excelled neither at academia nor at athletics. He attended eight schools and \"failed his exams at all of them.\" After a series of odd jobs, he was accepted against all odds at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), and became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. When he first took up acting, it was not with the notion of a prospective career, but rather to escape (in his own words) 'a messy childhood.' Warner received some early mentoring from one of his teachers, and made his theatrical debut in 1962 at the Royal Court Theatre as Snout in A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by Tony Richardson . A year later, he became the youngest-ever actor to play Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Comedy may not have been his forte as much as the likes of Falstaff, Lysander and (on several occasions) Henry VI. Eventually becoming disaffected with the theatre (and plagued for some years by stage fright), Warner found himself better served by the celluloid medium. His first big break came on the strength of his small part in A Midsummer Night's Dream, courtesy of Tony Richardson who cast him in his bawdy period romp Tom Jones (1963) as the mendacious, pimple-faced antagonist Blifil, who vied with Albert Finney for the affections of Susannah York . A proper starring turn on the big screen followed in due course with the title role in Morgan! (1966) , Warner playing a deranged artist with Marxist leanings who goes to absurd lengths to reclaim his ex-wife (played by Vanessa Redgrave ), including blowing up his mother-in-law. In yet another off-beat satire, Work Is a Four Letter Word (1968) , Warner played a corporate drop-out who grows psychedelic mushrooms in an automated world of the future. Combined with his two-year stint as Hamlet with the RSC, Warner became a star at age 24. By the 1970s, he had become one of Britain's most sought-after character actors and went on to enjoy an illustrious and prolific career on both sides of the Atlantic, throughout which he rarely spurned a role offered him. Tall and somewhat ungainly in appearance, Warner excelled at troubled, introspective loners, outcasts and mavericks or downright sinister individuals. The latter have included SS General Reinhardt Heydrich in Holocaust (1978) , Jack the Ripper in Time After Time (1979) , Picard's sadistic Cardassian torturer Gul Madred in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) , the villainous ex-Pinkerton man Spicer Lovejoy in Titanic (1997) and the evil geniuses of Time Bandits (1981) (a role turned down by Jonathan Pryce ) and Tron (1982) . He also essayed the creature to Robert Powell 's Frankenstein (1984) . Less eccentric roles saw him as the doomed photojournalist who literally loses his head in The Omen (1976) (Warner later described the experience of working alongside Gregory Peck as a career highlight), the sympathetic, but equally ill-fated Klingon Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) and the sad, likeable fantasist Aldous Gajic, searching for the Grail in Babylon 5 (1993) . Warner also appeared in a trio of films for which he was handpicked by the director Sam Peckinpah . Best of these is arguably the comedy western The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) , with Warner well cast as the roving-eyed, itinerant Reverend Joshua Duncan Sloane. Warner won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series for his performance as the Roman Senator Pomponius Falco in the miniseries Masada (1981) . Following a three-decade long absence, Warner returned to the stage in 2001 for the role of Andrew Undershaft in Shaw's Major Barbara. In 2004, he played the title role in King Lear at the Chichester Theatre Festival in England. More recently, he appeared on TV as Professor Abraham Van Helsing in Penny Dreadful (2014) , as Rabbi Max Steiner in Ripper Street (2012) and as Kenneth Branagh 's ailing father in Wallander (2008) . A riveting screen presence, the ever-versatile and charismatic David Warner passed away aged 80 from cancer at Denville Hall, an entertainment industry care home, in Northwood, London, on 24 July 2022. - IMDb mini biography by: I.S.Mowis",

He died on July 22, 2013 in Scottsdale, Arizona at age 69. - IMDb mini biography by: Anonymous Actor Dennis Farina is unique among thespians in that he was one of the few to achieve success as a \"late-bloomer.\" He did not start acting until he was 37 years old, after stints in the military and 18 years on the Chicago Police Department. He made his bones in show business as a character actor, often cast as a cop or gangster. Though often cast as heavies, Farina was also adept at comedy roles. A leap year baby born on February 29, 1944 into a Sicilian-American family, Farina's father Joseph, a physician, was an immigrant from Sicily. After a stint in the service, the Chicago native pinned on a badge and strapped on a gun for the Windy City's police department from 1967 to 1985. He mostly worked out of the burglary division, which brought him his chance. While he was still a cop in burglary, he was hired as a consultant by director Michael Mann for the movie Thief (1981) , in which James Caan played a master burglar. Mann cast Farina in a bit part in the movie, which proved to be a small masterpiece. He worked many times with Mann in the future. Bitten by the acting bug, Farina started acting in Chicago theater before Mann cast him in a lead role in his TV series Crime Story (1986) . Even though Farina was two years short of his pension, he quit the Chicago PD to take a chance on acting. He worked steadily in TV and movies ever since. Farina proved adept at both drama and comedy, as his turn as gangster Ray \"Bones\" Barboni, John Travolta 's rival in Get Shorty (1995) attested to. In addition to \"Crime Story\", he also had a major role on Law & Order (1990) , essentially replacing Jerry Orbach 's character. His last recurring role on TV was in the 2012 horse racing series Luck (2011) . He was married for 10 years, from 1970 until his divorce in 1980. He and his wife Patricia had three sons; one of them, Joe Farina , became an actor. Dennis Farina died in Scottsdale, Arizona on July 22, 2013 from a blood clot in his lung. He was 69 years old. - IMDb mini biography by: Jon C. Hopwood",

Burns, a police sergeant as well as active spokesperson for the New York Police. He was raised as a Catholic. He as well as his older sister Mary & brother, Brian, were raised in Long Island. He attended Catholic Chaminade High School before transferring to a public high school. He went on to attend The State University of New York at Albany & Oneonta College in New York to major in English literature. During his junior year, he transferred to Hunter College in Manhattan, studied filmmaking & began writing short films. After graduating, he secured a job at Entertainment Tonight through his father's connections, working at as a \"go-fer.\" There he was able to finance & begin working on The Brothers McMullen (1995) , a comedy focusing on the trials & tribulations facing 3\nIrish-Catholic siblings. It was shot primarily in his parents' Long Island home w/ a cast of unknowns such as himself & Maxine Bahns . It was filmed over 8 months/ a reported budget of only $30,000. Rejected by a series of distributors, The Brothers McMullen (1995) bowed at Sundance after he had given Robert Redford a copy of the film while working on ET. In 1995, his film won the festival's Grand Jury Prize, becoming 1 of the most successful independent efforts of the year. He then sold the film to 20th Century Fox's Searchlight Pictures. For his follow-up, he wrote & directed She's the One (1996) , which retained much of McMullen's cast & crew. He was also able to cast up-and-coming stars Jennifer Aniston & Cameron Diaz in pivotal roles w/ original music from rocker Tom Petty. Filmed w/ a larger budget of almost $3 million, the romantic comedy successfully premiered during the summer of 1996 . He soon began work on his 3rd film No Looking Back, a romantic drama set in a coastal town's working-class community. In 1998, he co-starred in the Steven Spielberg World War II epic Saving Private Ryan (1998) . Afterwards, he continued to have a successful year. However, his next few films such as Sidewalks of New York (2001) didn't make much of a dent in the box office. He's committed to writing & directing his own films. He's not affected by his work & continues his own projects, even tackling touchy relationship subjects & pioneering real-life matters. With his panoply of Woody Allen -like films, he'll continue to dazzle while gaining recognition. - IMDb mini biography by: Jurisprudence",

His uncle is actor Denis Lawson . He was raised in Crieff. At age 16, he left Morrison Academy to join the Perth Repertory Theatre. His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course.

He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract. After his cousin, Miguel Ferrer , got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979) ; Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988) ; and Detective James Falconer on Sisters (1991) . Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series ER (1994) , opposite Anthony Edwards , Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies . While filming \"ER\" (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez 's From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) , and One Fine Day (1996) , opposite Michelle Pfeiffer . In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher 's Batman & Robin (1997) . The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh 's Out of Sight (1998) , Terrence Malick 's The Thin Red Line (1998) , and David O. Russell 's Three Kings (1999) . In 1999, Clooney left \"ER\" (1994) (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou?

He didn't win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne 's The Descendants (2011) . Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake.

After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again.

Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler . In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney , with whom he has two children, twins. - IMDb mini biography by: Anonymous and Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>",

His parents, working in Europe at the time of his birth, settled in Manhattan by the time he was 6, and that's where he grew up. Coming from a theatrical background, it was, perhaps, inevitable that young Giancarlo would appear on stage sooner or later, and he did, at age 8, appearing on Broadway as a slave child in \"Maggie Flynn\" in 1966. More Broadway work followed through the 1960s and early '70s, followed by some small roles in movies. TV work followed in the 1980s, with increasingly significant parts in a string of high-profile series until he became well-established as a character player both on TV and in a number of movies. He came very much to the public's attention playing Agent Mike Giardello in the TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) in 1998 and since then has rarely been off our screens. - IMDb mini biography by: Anonymous",

      "biography": "Stanton was born in West Irvine, Kentucky, to Ersel (Moberly), a cook, and Sheridan Harry Stanton, a barber and tobacco farmer. He lived in Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Lafayette Senior High School with the class of 1944. Drafted into the Navy, he served as a cook in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was on board an LST during the Battle of Okinawa. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to appear in a production of \"Pygmalion\", before heading out to California and honing his craft at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. Stanton then toured around the United States with a male choir, worked in children's theater, and then headed back to California. His first role on screen was in the tepid movie Tomahawk Trail (1957) , but he was quickly noticed and appeared regularly in minor roles as cowboys and soldiers through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His star continued to rise and he received better roles in which he could showcase his laid-back style, such as in Cool Hand Luke (1967) , Kelly's Heroes (1970) , Dillinger (1973) , The Godfather Part II (1974) , and in Alien (1979) . It was around this time that Stanton came to the attention of director Wim Wenders , who cast him in his finest role yet as Travis in the moving Paris, Texas (1984) . Next indie director Alex Cox gave Stanton a role that brought him to the forefront, in the quirky cult film Repo Man (1984) . Stanton was now heavily in demand, and his unique look got him cast as everything from a suburban father in the mainstream Pretty in Pink (1986) to a soft-hearted, but ill-fated, private investigator in Wild at Heart (1990) and a crazy yet cunning scientist in Escape from New York (1981) . Apart from his film performances, he was also an accomplished musician, and \"The Harry Dean Stanton Band\" and their unique spin on mariachi music played together for well over a decade. They toured internationally. He became a cult figure of cinema and music and when Debbie Harry sang the lyric, \"I want to dance with Harry Dean...\" in her 1990s hit \"I Want That Man\", she was talking about him. Stanton remained consistently active on screen, lastly appearing in films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) , The Green Mile (1999) and The Man Who Cried (2000) . - IMDb mini biography by: firehouse44",

      "biography": "Sir Ian Holm was one of the world's greatest actors, a Laurence Olivier Award-winning, Tony Award-winning, BAFTA-winning and Academy Award-nominated British star of films and the stage. He was a member of the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company and has played more than 100 roles in films and on television. He was born Ian Holm Cuthbert on September 12, 1931, in Goodmayes, Essex, to Scottish parents who worked at the Essex mental asylum. His mother, Jean Wilson (née Holm), was a nurse, and his father, Doctor James Harvey Cuthbert, was a psychiatrist. Young Holm was brought up in London. At the age of seven he was inspired by the seeing 'Les Miserables' and became fond of acting. Holm studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1950 to the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he emerged as an actor whose range and effortless style allowed him to play almost entire Shakespeare's repertoire. In 1959 his stage partner Laurence Olivier scored a hit on Ian Holm in a sword fight in a production of 'Coriolanus'. Holm still had a scar on his finger. In 1965 Holm made his debut on television as Richard III on the BBC's The Wars of the Roses (1965) , which was a filmed theatrical production of four of Shakespeare's plays condensed down into a trilogy. In 1969 Holm won his first BAFTA Film Award Best Supporting Actor for The Bofors Gun (1968) , then followed a flow of awards and nominations for his numerous works in film and on television. In 1981, he played one of his best known roles, Sam Mussabini in Chariots of Fire (1981) , for which he was nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In the late 1990s, he gave a highly-acclaimed turn as the lawyer, Mitchell, in Atom Egoyan 's The Sweet Hereafter (1997) , and was subsequently cast in a number of high-profile Hollywood films of the next decade, playing Father Vito Cornelius in The Fifth Element (1997) , Bilbo in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) , and Professor Fitz in The Aviator (2004) , as well as Zach Braff 's character's father Gideon in Garden State (2004) . His last non-Hobbit film role was a voice part as Skinner in Ratatouille (2007) . Ian Holm had five children, three daughters and two sons from the first two of his four wives and from an additional relationship. In 1989 Holm was created a Commander of the British Empire (CBE), and in 1998 he was knighted for his services to drama. He died in London in June 2020. - IMDb mini biography by: Steve Shelokhonov",

      "biography": "English writer, scholar and philologist, Tolkien's father was a bank\nmanager in South Africa. Shortly before his father died (1896) his mother took\nhim and his younger brother to his father's native village of Sarehole,\nnear Birmingham, England. The landscapes and Nordic mythology of the\nMidlands may have been the source for Tolkien's fertile imagination to\nwrite about 'the Shire' and 'hobbits' in his later book the Hobbit\n(1937). After his mother's death in 1904 he was looked after by Father\nFrancis Xavier Morgan a RC priest of the Congregation of the Oratory.\nTolkien was educated at King Edward VI school in Birmingham. He studied\nlinguistics at Exeter College, Oxford, and took his B.A. in 1915. In 1916 he fought in World War I with the Lancashire Fusiliers. It\nis believed that his experiences during the Battle of the Somne may have\nbeen fueled the darker side of his subsequent novels. Upon his return\nhe worked as an assistant on the Oxford English Dictionary (1918-20)\nand took his M.A. in 1919. In 1920 he became a teacher in English at\nthe University of Leeds. He then went on to Merton College in Oxford,\nwhere he became Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon\n(1925-45) and Merton professor of English Language and Literature\n(1945-59). His first scholarly publication was an edition of Sir Gawain\nand the Green Knight (1925). He also wrote books on Chaucer (1934) and\nBeowulf (1937). In 1939 Tolkien gave the Andrew Lang Lecture at the\nUniversity of St. Andrews in Scotland titled: \"On Fairy-Stories\".\nTolkien will however be remembered most for his books the Hobbit (1937)\nand the Lord of the Rings (1954-55). The Hobbit began as a bedtime\nstory for his children\". He wrote Lord of the Rings over a period of about 14 years. Tolkien also discussed parts of his novels with fellow Oxfordian and\nfantasy writer CS Lewis during their 'meetings'. He was trying to\ncreate a fantasy world so that he could explain how he had invented\ncertain languages, and in doing so created 'Middle-earth'. However\namong his peers at Oxford his works were not well received as they were\nnot considered 'scholarly'. It was after LOTR was published in\npaperback in the United States in 1965 that he developed his legendary\ncult following and also imitators. Tolkien was W. P. Ker lecturer at\nGlasgow University in 1953. In 1954 both the University of Liege and\nUniversity College, Dublin, awarded him honorary doctorates. He\nreceived the CBE in 1972. He served as vice-president of the\nPhilological Society and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of\nLiterature. He was made an honorary fellow of Exeter College. Despite the immense\npopularity of his books today Tolkien did not greatly benefit from\ntheir sales. His son Christopher Tolkien was able to publish some of\nhis works posthumously after his manuscripts were found. - IMDb mini biography by: Sujit R. Varma J.R.R. Tolkien was an English writer, poet, philologist, and professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. However, when it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel. The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes 1954-1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it. Tolkien at first intended The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale in the style of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. Tolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. - IMDb mini biography by: Pedro Borges",

He also specialized in the work of Seán O'Casey, creating the role of Joxer in the Broadway musical Juno in 1959, based with O'Casey's 1924 play about the Troubles, Juno and the Paycock. He played O'Casey's brother Archie in Young Cassidy (1965), one of John Ford's last films. In 1954 he moved to London, subsequently becoming a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

      "biography": "Jeremy Davies attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in\nPasadena, California. He made his film debut starring in David O. Russell's\nacclaimed first film, the Indy classic, \"Spanking the Monkey\", which\nbecame a surprise Sundance Film Festival winner, earning Jeremy an\nIndependent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance. Davies' portrayal of Tom Hanks' interpreter, 'Corporal Upham', in Steven\nSpielberg's Academy Award winning film, \"Saving Private Ryan\" also\nearned him considerable critical acclaim and subsequent Oscar buzz. Davies' other film credits include Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris\", with\nGeorge Clooney and Viola Davis; \"Going All the Way\" with Ben Affleck;\n\"The Locusts\" with Vince Vaughn; Wim Wenders' \"Million Dollar Hotel\";\nLars von Trier's acclaimed avant-garde films, \"Dogville\" and\n\"Manderlay\" with Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgard; \"Rescue Dawn\"\nwith Christian Bale and Steve Zahn, and directed by the legendary\nWerner Herzog; \"Nell\" with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson; \"Half Nelson\"\nwriter/directors Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden's \"It's Kind of a Funny\nStory\"; \"Guncrazy\" with Drew Barrymore, and Jan de Bont's \"Twister\"\nwith Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In television, Davies was invited to join the cast of JJ Abram's\ngroundbreaking show, \"Lost\", and soon after, his character, 'Daniel\nFaraday', quickly became an integral part of the \"Lost\" mythology and a\nfavorite of critics and fans (to the extent that ABC began selling\nFaraday bobbleheads). After \"Lost\", Davies joined Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins and Margo\nMartindale on Graham Yost's acclaimed, Emmy winning FX show,\n\"Justified\", based on a short story by the great Elmore Leonard. Wildly\nagainst his better judgment, Yost generously granted Jeremy unusual\nfreedom to develop the character of Mags Bennett's middle son, and\nDavies' subsequent ferocious and fragile Richard the Third-esque\nportrayal of Harlan, Kentucky outlaw 'Dickie Bennett' was so far\nremoved from 'Daniel Faraday', his work earned him an Emmy Award for\nOutstanding Guest Actor. Davies' television work also includes the Emmy-honored HBO film, \"The\nLaramie Project\". Davies was raised without television, and experienced a vividly nomadic\n(non-military brat), low-income childhood, growing up throughout the US\nand abroad, including Vermont, Seattle, Oregon, Kansas, Michigan, New\nOrleans, Latin America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and the Kingdom of\nCalifornia. - IMDb mini biography by: Untitled Entertainment",

      "biography": "One of England's most versatile character actors, Jim Broadbent was\nborn on May 24, 1949 in Lincolnshire, the youngest son of sculptress\nDoreen \"Dee\" (Findlay) and furniture maker Roy Laverick Broadbent.\nHe attended a Quaker boarding school in Reading, then successfully\napplying for a place at an art school, but his heart was in acting and he\ntransferred into the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).\nAfter he graduated in 1972, he began his professional career on the stage,\nperforming with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company,\nand as part of the National Theatre of Brent, a two-man troupe which he\nco-founded. In addition to his theatrical work, Broadbent did steady work on\ntelevision, working for such directors as Mike Newell and Stephen Frears . Broadbent made his film debut in 1978 with a small part in Jerzy Skolimowski 's The Shout (1978) . He went on to work\nwith Frears again in The Hit (1984) and\nwith Terry Gilliam in Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985) , but it was through his\ncollaboration with Mike Leigh that\nBroadbent first became known to an international film audience. In 1990\nhe starred in Leigh's Life Is Sweet (1990) , a domestic\ncomedy that cast him as a good-natured cook who dreams of running his\nown business. Broadbent gained further visibility the following year\nwith substantial roles in Neil Jordan 's The Crying Game (1992) and Mike Newell 's Enchanted April (1991) , and he\ncould subsequently be seen in such diverse fare as Woody Allen 's Bullets Over Broadway (1994) , Widows' Peak (1994) , Richard Loncraine 's highly acclaimed\nadaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III (1995) , and Little Voice (1998) , the last of\nwhich cast him as a seedy nightclub owner. Appearing primarily as a\ncharacter actor in these films, Broadbent took center stage for Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (1999) , imbuing the\nmercurial W.S. Gilbert with emotional complexity and comic poignancy.\nJim's breakthrough year was 2001, as he starred in three critically and\ncommercially successful films. Many would consider him the definitive\nsupporting actor of that year. First he starred as Bridget's dad (Colin\nJones) in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) ,\nwhich propelled Renée Zellweger to an\nOscar nomination for Best Actress. Next came the multiple\nOscar-nominated film (including Best Picture) Moulin Rouge! (2001) , for which he\nwon a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA award for his scene-stealing\nperformance as Harold Zidler. Lastly, came the small biopic Iris (2001) , for which he won the Oscar\nfor Best Supporting Actor as devoted husband John Bayley to Judi Dench 's Iris Murdoch, the British\nnovelist who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The film hit home with\nJim, since his own mother had passed away from Alzheimer's in 1995. - IMDb mini biography by: TrendEkiD@aol.com",

      "biography": "One of stage, screen and TV's finest transatlantic talents, slight, gravel-voiced John Vincent Hurt was born on January 22, 1940, in Shirebrook, a coal mining village, in Derbyshire, England. The youngest child of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Reverend Arnould Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, his quiet shyness betrayed an early passion for acting. First enrolled at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin's School of Art, his focus invariably turned from painting to acting. Accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1960, John made his stage debut in \"Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger\" followed by \"The Dwarfs.\" Elsewhere, he continued to build upon his 60's theatrical career with theatre roles in \"Chips with Everything\" at the Vaudeville, the title role in \"Hamp\" at the Edinburgh Festival, \"Inadmissible Evidence\" at Wyndham's and \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs\" at the Garrick. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the \"angry young man\" British drama Young and Willing (1962) , followed by small roles in Appuntamento in Riviera (1962) , A Man for All Seasons (1966) and [link Hurt found his more compelling early work in offbeat theatrical characterizations with notable roles such as Malcolm in \"Macbeth\" (1967), Octavius in \"Man and Superman\" (1969), Peter in \"Ride a Cock Horse\" (1972), Mike in '\"The Caretaker\" (1972) and Ben in \"The Dumb Waiter\" (1973). At the same time he gained more prominence in a spray of film and support roles such as a junior officer in Before Winter Comes (1969) , the title highwayman in Sinful Davey (1969) , a morose little brother in In Search of Gregory (1969) , a dim, murderous truck driver in 10 Rillington Place (1971) , a skirt-chasing, penguin-studying biologist in Cry of the Penguins (1971) , the unappetizing son of a baron in The Pied Piper (1972) and a repeat of his title stage role as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974) . Hurt shot to international stardom, however, on TV where he was allowed to display his true, fearless range. He reaped widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play The Naked Civil Servant (1975) , adapted from Crisp's autobiography. Hurt's bold, unabashed approach on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the BAFTA (British TV Award). This triumph led to the equally fascinating success as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece I, Claudius (1976) , followed by another compelling interpretation as murderous student Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1979) . A resurgence occurred on film as a result. Among other unsurpassed portraits on his unique pallet, the chameleon in him displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in The Elephant Man (1980) , and as a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama Midnight Express (1978) earning Oscar nominations for both. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien (1979) . With this new rush of fame came a few misguided ventures as well that were generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Champions (1984) or kidnapper in The Hit (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Partners (1982) with Ryan O'Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. For the most part, the craggy-faced actor continued to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Scandal (1989) ; the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling \"pretty-boy\" actor Jason Priestley in Love and Death on Long Island (1997) ; and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Shooting Dogs (2005) . Latter parts of memorable interpretations included Dr. Iannis in Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) , the recurring role of the benign wand-maker Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) , the tyrannical dictator Adam Sutler in V for Vendetta (2005) and the voice of The Dragon in Merlin (2008) . Among Hurt's final film appearances were as a terminally ill screenwriter in That Good Night (2017) and a lesser role in the mystery thriller Damascus Cover (2017) . Hurt's voice was also tapped into animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. He also returned to the theatre performing in such shows as \"The Seagull\", \"A Month in the Country\" (1994), \"Afterplay\" (2002) and \"Krapp's Last Tape\", the latter for which he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award. A recovered alcoholic who married four times, Hurt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 2004, and Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. That same year (2015) he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In July of 2016, he was forced to bow out of the father role of Billy Rice in a then-upcoming London stage production of \"The Entertainer\" opposite Kenneth Branagh due to ill health that he described as an \"intestinal ailment\". Hurt died several months later at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday. - IMDb mini biography by: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net and Markos.",

      "biography": "Fast-talking and feisty-looking John Leguizamo has continued to impress movie audiences with his versatility: he can play sensitive and naïve young men, such as Johnny in Hangin' with the Homeboys (1991) ; cold-blooded killers like Benny Blanco in Carlito's Way (1993) ; a heroic Army Green Beret, stopping aerial terrorists in Executive Decision (1996) ; and drag queen Chi-Chi Rodriguez in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995) . Arguably, not since ill-fated actor and comedian Freddie Prinze starred in the smash TV series Chico and the Man (1974) had a youthful Latino personality had such a powerful impact on critics and fans alike. John Alberto Leguizamo Peláez was born July 22, 1960, in Bogotá, Colombia, to Luz Marina Peláez and Alberto Rudolfo Leguizamo. He was a child when his family emigrated to the United States. He was raised in Queens, New York, attended New York University and studied under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg for only one day before Strasberg passed away. The extroverted Leguizamo started working the comedy club circuit in New York and first appeared in front of the cameras in an episode of Miami Vice (1984) . His first film appearance was a small part in Mixed Blood (1984) , and he had minor roles in Casualties of War (1989) and Die Hard 2 (1990) before playing a liquor store thief who shoots Harrison Ford in Regarding Henry (1991) . His career really started to soar after his first-rate performance in the independent film Hangin' with the Homeboys (1991) as a nervous young teenager from the Bronx out for a night in brightly lit Manhattan with his buddies, facing the career choice of staying in a supermarket or heading off to college and finding out that the girl he loves from afar isn't quite what he thought she was. The year 1991 was also memorable for other reasons, as he hit the stage with his show John Leguizamo: Mambo Mouth (1991) , in which he portrayed seven different Latino characters. The witty and incisive show was a smash hit and won the Obie and Outer Circle Critics Award, and later was filmed for HBO, where it picked up a CableACE Award. He returned to the stage two years later with another satirical production poking fun at Latino stereotypes titled John Leguizamo: Spic-O-Rama (1993) . It played in Chicago and New York, and won the Drama Desk Award and four CableACE Awards. In 1995 he created and starred in the short-lived TV series House of Buggin' (1995) , an all-Latino-cast comedy variety show featuring hilarious sketches and comedic routines. The show scored two Emmy nominations and received positive reviews from critics, but it was canceled after only one season. The gifted Leguizamo was still keeping busy in films, with key appearances in Super Mario Bros. (1993) , Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Spawn (1997) . In 1998 he made his Broadway debut in John Leguizamo: Freak (1998) , a \"demi-semi-quasi-pseudo-autobiographical\" one-man show, which was filmed for HBO by Spike Lee . Utilizing his distinctive vocal talents, he next voiced a pesky rat in Doctor Dolittle (1998) before appearing in the dynamic Spike Lee -directed Summer of Sam (1999) as a guilt-ridden womanizer, as the Genie of The Lamp in the exciting Arabian Nights (2000) and as Henri DE Toulouse Lautrec in the visually spectacular Moulin Rouge! (2001) . He also voiced Sid in the animated Ice Age (2002) , co-starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in Collateral Damage (2002) and directed and starred in the boxing film Undefeated (2003) . Subsequently, Leguizamo starred in the remake of the John Carpenter hit Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) and George A. Romero 's long-awaited fourth \"Dead\" film, Land of the Dead (2005) . There can be no doubt that the remarkably talented Leguizamo has been a breakthrough performer for the Latino community in mainstream Hollywood, in much the same way that Sidney Poitier crashed through celluloid barriers for African-Americans in the early 1960s. Among his many strengths lies his ability to not take his ethnic background too seriously but also to take pride in his Latino heritage. He has opened many doors for his countrymen. A masterly and accomplished performer, movie audiences await Leguizamo's next exciting performance. - IMDb mini biography by: firehouse44@hotmail.com",

One thing that Jonathan does not like is meat.

      "biography": "Ask Kate Winslet what she likes about any of her characters, and the word \"ballsy\" is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica. Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Heavenly Creatures (1994) . The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics. Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee 's Sense and Sensibility (1995) . She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson , and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh 's Hamlet (1996) . The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron 's Titanic (1997) . Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations. After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997) , Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999) . The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000) . Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader (2008) , playing a former concentration camp guard. For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015) , she received her seventh Academy Award nomination. Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss. In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton . They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to Drama. - IMDb mini biography by: IMDb Editors",

      "biography": "Multi-talented, multi-award-winning actress Kathleen (Doyle) Bates was born on June 28, 1948, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. She is the youngest of three girls born to Bertye Kathleen (Talbot), a homemaker, and Langdon Doyle Bates, a mechanical engineer. Her grandfather was author Finis L. Bates. Kathy has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry, and one of her ancestors, an Irish emigrant to New Orleans, once served as President Andrew Jackson's doctor. Kathy discovered acting appearing in high school plays and studied drama at Southern Methodist University, graduating in 1969. With her mind firmly set, she moved to New York City in 1970 and paid her dues by working everything from a cash register to taking lunch orders. Things started moving quickly up the ladder after giving a tour-de-force performance alongside Christopher Walken at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in Lanford Wilson 's world premiere of \"Lemon Sky\" in 1970, but she also had a foreshadowing of the heartbreak to come after the successful show relocated to New York's off-Broadway Playhouse Theatre without her and Walken wound up winning a Drama Desk award. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Kathy was treading the boards frequently as a\nrising young actress of the New York and regional theater scene. She\nappeared in \"Casserole\" and \"A Quality of Mercy\" (both 1975) before\nearning exceptional reviews for her role of Joanne in \"Vanities\". She\ntook her first Broadway curtain call in 1980's \"Goodbye Fidel,\" which\nlasted only six performances. She then went directly into replacement\nmode when she joined the cast of the already-established and highly\nsuccessful \"Fifth of July\" in 1981. Kathy made a false start in films with Taking Off (1971) , in which she was\nbilled as \"Bobo Bates\". She didn't film again until Straight Time (1978) , starring Dustin Hoffman , and that part was not\nsubstantial enough to cause a stir. Things turned hopeful, however,\nwhen Kathy and the rest of the female ensemble were given the chance to\nplay their respective Broadway parts in the film version of Robert Altman 's Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982) .\nIt was a juicy role for Kathy and film audiences finally started\nnoticing the now 34-year-old. Still and all, it was the New York stage that continued to earn Kathy\nawards and acclaim. She was pure textbook to any actor studying how to\ndisappear into a role. Her characters ranged from free and\nlife-affirming to downright pitiable. Despite winning a Tony Award\nnomination and Outer Critic's Circle Award for her stark, touchingly\nsad portrait of a suicidal daughter in 1983's \"'night, Mother\" and the\nObie and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for her powerhouse job as a\nromantic misfit in \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,\" Kathy\nhad no box-office pull, however, and was never a strong consideration when the\nroles transferred to the screen. Her award-winning stage went to established film stars. First Sissy Spacek took over her potent role as the\nsuicidal Jessie Cates in 'night, Mother (1986) , then Michelle Pfeiffer seized the moment to\nplay her dumpy lover character in Frankie and Johnny (1991) . It\nwould take Oscar glory to finally rectify the injustice. It was Kathy's fanatical turn as the drab, chunky, porcine-looking\npsychopath Annie Wilkes, who kidnaps her favorite author\n( James Caan ) and subjects him to a\nseries of horrific tortures, that finally turned the tide for her in\nHollywood. With the 1990 shocker Misery (1990) , based on the popular Stephen King novel, Bates and Caan\nwere box office magic. Moreover, Kathy captured the \"Best Actress\"\nOscar and Golden Globe award, a first in that genre (horror) for that\ncategory. To add to her happiness she married Tony Campisi , also an actor, in 1991. Quality film scripts now started coming her way and the 1990s proved to\nbe a rich and rewarding time for her. First, she and another older\n\"overnight\" film star, fellow Oscar winner Jessica Tandy , starred together in the\nmodern portion of the beautifully nuanced, flashback period piece Fried Green Tomatoes (1991) .\nShe then outdid herself as the detached and depressed housekeeper\naccused of murdering her abusive husband\n( David Strathairn ) in Dolores Claiborne (1995) .\nSurprisingly, she was left out of the Oscar race for these two\nexcellent performances. Not so, however, for her flashy political\nadvisor Libby Holden in the movie Primary Colors (1998) , receiving praise and a\n\"Best Supporting Actress\" nomination. Kathy has continued to work prolifically on TV as a 14-time Emmy winner or nominee thus far. She has also taken to directing a couple of TV-movies on the sly. As most actors, she has been in hit and miss TV shows. On the hit side, she has earned a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Jay Leno's manager playing tough politics in The Late Shift (1995) and played to the hilt the cruel-minded orphanage operator, Miss Hannigan, in Annie (1999) for which she also earned an Emmy nom. She has done some eye-catching, offbeat turns on regular series such as Six Feet Under (2001) (for which she also earned a DGA award for helming an episode), The Office (2005) , Harry's Law (2011) and especially American Horror Story (2011) for which she won an Emmy as Ethel Darling. She also won an Emmy for a guest episode on the hit sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003) . Interesting millennium filming have included a Catholic school's Mother Superior in the comic drama Bruno (2000) ; Jesse James' mother in American Outlaws (2001) ; a quirky, liberal mom in About Schmidt (2002) for which she earned another \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination; a brief but potent turn as Gertrude Stein in Woody Allen 's Midnight in Paris (2011) ; Queen Victoria in the adventurous remake of Around the World in 80 Days (2004) ; wacky parent types in the comedies Failure to Launch (2006) and Relative Strangers (2006) ; Mother Claus in the seasonal farce Fred Claus (2007) ; an over-gushy foster mother in the dramedy The Great Gilly Hopkins (2015) ; and a wrenching performance as the mother of a suspected terrorist in Richard Jewell (2019) for which she earned her third \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar nomination. Divorced from husband Campisi since 1997, Kathy has been the Executive\nCommittee Chair of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture\nArts and Sciences Board of Governors. - IMDb mini biography by: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net",

She signed with PWL Records and hit-makers\nStock/Aitken/Waterman in 1987.

      "biography": "Laura Fraser was born on July 24, 1975 and brought up in Glasgow. Her\nfather, Alister, used to run a small building company but is now an\naspiring scriptwriter; her mother, Rose, used to be a nurse but is now a\ncollege lecturer. She has an older brother who works with computers, a\nyounger sister who is studying philosophy at university, and a younger\nbrother who hasn't yet decided what he wants to do. Laura describes her\nfamily as a pretty close bunch. Alister Fraser was instrumental in getting his daughter into acting when\nshe was at school. He wrote a play for the youth club in which she\nplayed the female lead. After completing High School, Laura did a drama\nfoundation course at Glasgow's Langside College, and then went to the\nprestigious Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. During her time there, she got a supporting role in Gillies MacKinnon's\nfilm Small Faces (1995) . This was on top of a couple of other\nminor roles she had taken (such as 'Big Day for the Bad Guys). The\ncollege authorities took a pretty dim view of the amount of professional\nwork she had been taking on, questioning her commitment to the course. Having not been enjoying her time at the Academy, and encouraged by her\nparents, she dropped out after a year and moved to London. She landed\nthe starring female role in the BBC adaptation of Neil Gaiman's\n_\"NeverWhere\" (1996) (mini)_ series, and then moved to several small or\nsupporting roles in films (Cousin Bette, Man in the Iron Mask), as well\nas a lead in the short film 'Paris Brixton'. She also appeared as a\nminor character in single TV dramas, such as 'The Investigator' and 'The\nTribe'). Her role in the movie Left Luggage (1998) was more\nsubstantial and led to her getting one of the main character roles in\nthe black comedy Divorcing Jack (1998) (at least in the first\nhalf). And her highest profile performance as the lead female in the\ncomedy Virtual Sexuality (1999) in 1998. From here she has appeared in a number of films, mainly in supporting\nroles, but always noticeable. Her performance as Lavinia in the offbeat\nversion of Titus (1999) has particularly been singled out for\npraise. All these roles have demonstrated her versatility in\ncharacterization and style to the full. From the fantasy of\n'Neverwhere,' comedy of 'Virtual Sexuality,' Shakespearean drama of\n'Titus,' emotional drama of 'Forgive and Forget' and slapstick of 'Kevin\nand Perry,' Laura cannot be typecast. She effortlessly adapts to all\nthe genres (and accents where needed; she has rarely appeared acting\nusing her own Glasgow accent). Laura moved to America after completing Coney Island Baby (2002) .\nShe landed a role in the well regarded HBO drama Iron Jawed Angels (2004) , and also met up with Karl Geary, her co-star in\n'Coney Island Baby.' They lived together in Brooklyn, and subsequently\nmarried in New York in 2003. They moved to Ireland in mid 2004. In early 2005, Laura returned to live in Glasgow with her husband and\nstepdaughter, and a desire to start a family and focus on local work.\nShe found she was pregnant in late 2005, and spent time working as a\nchoreographer on a pantomime written by her father 'Oh Yes He Is!' for\nthe charity Sense Scotland. In May 2006 she and Karl became proud\nparents of a baby girl. Laura intended to not work for 12 months and be\na full-time mum, but by September 2006 she was back making a film for\nthe BBC. - IMDb mini biography by: Clive Sarney",

      "biography": "Lee J. Cobb, one of the premier character actors in American film for\nthree decades in the post-World War II period, was born Leo Jacoby in\nNew York City's Lower East Side on December 8, 1911. The son of a\nJewish newspaper editor, young Leo was a child prodigy in music,\nmastering the violin and the harmonica. Any hopes of a career as a\nviolin virtuoso were dashed when he broke his wrist, but his talent on\nthe harmonica may have brought him his first professional success. At\nthe age of 16 or 17 he ran away from home to Hollywood to try to break\ninto motion pictures as an actor. He reportedly made his film debut as\na member of Borrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals (their first known movie appearance was in the 1929 two-reeler Boyhood\nDays), but that cannot be substantiated. However, it's known that after\nLeo was unable to find work he returned to New York City, where he\nattended New York University at night to study accounting while\nacting in radio dramas during the day. An older Cobb tried his luck in California once more, making his debut\nas a professional stage actor at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1931. After\nagain returning to his native New York, he made his Broadway debut as a\nsaloonkeeper in a dramatization of Fyodor Dostoevsky 's Crime and\nPunishment, but it closed after 15 performances (later in his career,\nDostoevsky would prove more of a charm, with Cobb's role as Father\nKaramazov in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) garnering him his second Oscar nomination), Cobb joined the politically progressive Group Theater in 1935 and made\na name for himself in Clifford Odets '\npolitically liberal dramas Waiting for Lefty and Til the Day I Die,\nappearing in both plays that year in casts that included Elia Kazan , who later became famous as a film\ndirector. Cobb also appeared in the 1937 Group Theater production of\nOdets' Golden Boy, playing the role of Mr. Carp, in a cast that also\nincluded Kazan, Julius Garfinkle (later better known under his stage\nname of John Garfield ), and Martin Ritt , all of whom later came\nunder the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee during\nthe heyday of the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria more than a decade later.\nCobb took over the role of Mr. Bonaparte, the protagonist's father, in\nthe 1939 film version of the play, despite the fact that he was not yet\n30 years old. The role of a patriarch suited him, and he'd play many\nmore in his film career. It was as a different kind of patriarch that he scored his greatest\nsuccess. Cobb achieved immortality by giving life to the character of\nWilly Loman in the original 1949 Broadway production of Arthur Miller 's Death of a\nSalesman. His performance was a towering achievement that ranks with\nsuch performances as Edwin Booth as Richard III and John Barrymore as Hamlet in the\nannals of the American theater. Cobb later won an Emmy nomination as\nWilly when he played the role in a made-for-TV movie of the play\n( Death of a Salesman (1966) ).\nMiller said that he wrote the role with Cobb in mind. Before triumphing as Miller's Salesman, Cobb had appeared on Broadway\nonly a handful of times in the 1940s, including in Ernest Hemingway 's The Fifth Column\n(1940), Odets' \"Clash by Night\" (1942) and the US Army Air Force's\nWinged Victory (1943-44). Later he reprised the role of Joe Bonaparte's\nfather in the 1952 revival of Golden Boy opposite Garfield as his son,\nand appeared the following year in The Emperor's Clothes. His final\nBroadway appearance was as King Lear in the Repertory Theatre of\nLincoln Center's 1968 production of Shakespeare's play. Aside from his possible late 1920s movie debut and his 1934 appearance\nin the western The Vanishing Shadow (1934) ,\nCobb's film career proper began in 1937 with the westerns North of the Rio Grande (1937) (in which he was billed as Lee Colt) and Rustlers' Valley (1937) and\nspanned nearly 40 years until his death. After a hiatus while serving\nin the Army Air Force during World War II, Cobb's movie career resumed\nin 1946. He continued to play major supporting roles in prestigious\nA-list pictures. His movie career reached its artistic peak in the\n1950s, when he was twice nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy\nAwards, for his role as Johnny Friendly in On the Waterfront (1954) and as\nthe father in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) .\nOther memorable supporting roles in the 1950s included the sagacious\nJudge Bernstein in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956) ,\nas the probing psychiatrist Dr. Luther in The Three Faces of Eve (1957) and as the volatile Juror #3 in 12 Angry Men (1957) . It was in the 1950s that Cobb achieved the sort of fame that most\nartists dreaded: he was called before the House Un-American Activities\nCommittee on charges that he was or had been a Communist. The charges\nwere rooted in Cobb's membership in the Group Theater in the 1930s.\nOther Group Theater members already investigated by HUAC included Clifford Odets and Elia Kazan , both of whom provided friendly\ntestimony before the committee, and John Garfield , who did not. Cobb's own persecution by HUAC had already caused a nervous breakdown\nin his wife, and he decided to appear as a friendly witness in order to\npreserve her sanity and his career, by bringing the inquisition to a\nhalt. Appearing before the committee in 1953, he named names and thus\nsaved his career. Ironically, he would win his first Oscar nomination\nin On the Waterfront (1954) directed and written by fellow HUAC informers Kazan and Budd Schulberg . The film can be seen as a\nstalwart defense of informing, as epitomized by the character Terry\nMalloy's testimony before a Congressional committee investigating\nracketeering on the waterfront. Major films in which Cobb appeared after reaching his career plateau\ninclude Otto Preminger 's adaptation of Leon Uris ' ode to the birth of Israel, Exodus (1960) ; the Cinerama spectacle How the West Was Won (1962) ;\nthe James Coburn spy spoofs, Our Man Flint (1966) and In Like Flint (1967) ; Clint Eastwood 's first detective film, Coogan's Bluff (1968) ; and\nlegendary director William Wyler 's last\nfilm, The Liberation of L.B. Jones (1970) . In addition to his frequent supporting roles in film, Cobb often\nappeared on television. He played Judge Henry Garth on The Virginian (1962) from\n1962-66 and also had a regular role as the attorney David Barrett on The Young Lawyers (1969) from 1970-71. Cobb also appeared in made-for-TV movies and made\nfrequent guest appearances on other TV shows. His last major Hollywood\nmovie role was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in The Exorcist (1973) . Lee J. Cobb died of a heart attack in Woodland Hills, California, on\nFebruary 11, 1976, at the age of 64. He is buried in Mount Sinai\nMemorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Though he will long\nbe remembered for many of his successful supporting performances in the\nmovies, it is as the stage's first Willy Loman in which he achieved\nimmortality as an actor. Bearing in mind that the role was written for\nhim, it is through Willy that he will continue to have an influence on\nAmerican drama far into the future, for as long as Death of a Salesman\nis revived. - IMDb mini biography by: Jon C.

      "biography": "Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991) , to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997) , to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan . Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio . His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989) , but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991) , a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985) , in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) , a young gunslinger in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries (1995) , a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann 's Romeo + Juliet (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997) , which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997) , DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period. In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002) , his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese . With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed (2006) , Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan 's Inception (2010) , DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. In 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012) , and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) . DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society. - IMDb mini biography by: Pedro Borges",

      "biography": "Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role. Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984) , A Woman of Substance (1984) , The Mission (1986) , and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988) , which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990) , directed by Sam Raimi . From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993) , was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen 's Husbands and Wives (1992) , and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993) . The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor. Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson . The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994) , and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004) , played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan 's Batman Begins (2005) , and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) . Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010) , and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011) , The Grey (2011) , Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012) , as well as the sequel Wrath of the Titans (2012) . Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the\n1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996). - IMDb mini biography by: Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>",

      "biography": "From the age of five, Linda Blair had to get used to the spotlight,\nfirst as a child model and then as an actress, when out of 600\napplicants she was picked for the role of Regan, the possessed child,\nin The Exorcist (1973) . Linda\nquickly rose to international fame, won the Golden Globe, and seemed to\nbe set to take the Academy Award for that role, but when it leaked how\nsome parts of the role were not performed by her (the demonic voice was\ndubbed by Mercedes McCambridge , and\neight seconds of a stunt dummy were used) that dream broke, and with\nthat disappointment probably came the first blow to what looked like\nthe beginning of an A-list career. Over the next few years she had no trouble securing lead roles in a\nnumber of pictures, including the highly successful television films Born Innocent (1974) (the\n#1 TV movie of that year) and Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (1975) ,\nas well as the Exorcist sequel Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) .\nHowever, when she was peer pressured into buying cocaine at the age of\n18, it led to an arrest and subsequent sentencing to three years\nprobation. The much-publicized drug bust caused Linda to be blacklisted\nin Hollywood, and her career was soon reduced to B-movies and\noccasional TV guest appearances only. Although her career never returned to its former glory, Linda proved to\nbe a good sport about embracing the change, and out of the '80s emerged\nlead roles in two cult classics: the women-in-prison film Chained Heat (1983) and the femme\nfatale vigilante action film Savage Streets (1984) . She\ncontinued acting in numerous films throughout the '80s and '90s,\nincluding the Exorcist spoof Repossessed (1990) . In 1997, she also\ntook to the Broadway stage and starred as \"Rizzo\" in the revival of\n\"Grease.\" She received widespread mainstream attention again in the\n2000's with the theatrical re-release of the Exorcist, followed by a\nhosting job on the hit Fox Family TV series Scariest Places on Earth (2000) ,\nwhich ran for six years and followed Linda as she visited notorious\n\"haunted\" locations around the world. Linda was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Elinore, a real estate agent, and James, an executive headhunter. She has a brother, Jimmy, and a sister, Debbie. Linda has been a Hollywood icon for over 40 years, but it is her first\nlove of animals that has ultimately taken center stage in her life. She\nnow runs the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, a non-profit 501C3 tax\ndeductible organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating\nabused, neglected, and abandoned animals from the harsh streets of the\nLos Angeles area, as well as from the overcrowded and overwhelmed city\nand county animal shelters. She works and lives on the 2-acre rescue\nsanctuary full-time in California, which was featured on The Today Show\nin a segment titled \"From Devil to Angel.\" Of course, she also makes\nfrequent appearances at horror fan conventions to celebrate the legacy\nof The Exorcist (1973) . - IMDb mini biography by: <elmic@post8.tele.dk> and R.

      "biography": "A slight comic actor chiefly known for his boyish charm, Matthew\nBroderick was born on March 21, 1962 in New York City, to Patricia Broderick (née Biow), a\nplaywright and painter, and James Broderick , an actor. His\nfather had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland). Matthew initially took up acting at New York's upper-crust Walden\nSchool after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and\nsoccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17\nin a workshop production of the play \"On Valentine's Day\". Matthew's\ncareer then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play\n\"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (1982-83) and the feature film Max Dugan Returns (1983) .\nBroderick reprised the role of Eugene in \"Biloxi Blues\" (1988), the\nsecond installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway\nproduction and the film adaptation\n( Biloxi Blues (1988) ). For the third\nand final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman . In 1983,\nthe same year as Max Dugan Returns (1983) ,\nBroderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy WarGames (1983) . Since then he has had\nhis fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films\nincluding Project X (1987) also\nstarring Helen Hunt , whom he\nsubsequently dated; Addicted to Love (1997) ; and Inspector Gadget (1999) . Other\nfilms he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected\ninclude Out on a Limb (1992) with\nhis Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones ; The Night We Never Met (1993) ; The Road to Wellville (1994) ;\nand The Cable Guy (1996) with Jim Carrey , which got him an MTV \"Best Fight\"\naward nomination; and the MTV film Election (1999) with Reese Witherspoon . In 1985 he was\ninvolved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his\nthen fiancée Jennifer Grey . The crash\nkilled a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke\nhis leg in the accident, which happened just as Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) ,\nhis biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but\ncritical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzilla (1998) gave Broderick his\nfirst action role (should any \"Godzilla\" sequels be planned, he is\nunder contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage\nin New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \"How\nTo Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" or in revivals of old\n\"show people\"plays, such as \"Night Must Fall\". In 1996 Broderick\nattempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Infinity (1996) , working very closely\nwith his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical\nor commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since\nMay 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker . He was\npreviously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor . In 1999 he\ndonned a trenchcoat for the children's film Inspector Gadget (1999) ,\nalongside Rupert Everett as the evil\nvillain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the\nmusical smash \"The Producers\" (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He\nwas nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he\nlost to his co-star, Nathan Lane . - IMDb mini biography by: A. Nonymous",

      "biography": "Elegant blonde Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii to Anthony (a biochemist and clinical psychologist) and Janelle (a nursing instructor) Kidman. The family moved almost immediately to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, then, three years later, made the pilgrimage to her parents' native Sydney. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge - as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983) . That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in BMX Bandits (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Dead Calm (1989) . Kidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise 's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Days of Thunder (1990) , she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991) , then as Dustin Hoffman 's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991) . She reunited with Cruise for Far and Away (1992) , the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life (1993) . Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995) , but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant 's To Die For (1995) . As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion , on the adaptation of Henry James 's The Portrait of a Lady (1996) . A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997) , adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire. She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick 's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999) . The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's rumored homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman , discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001. - IMDb mini biography by: IMDb Editors",

      "biography": "Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Copeland Bloom was born on January 13, 1977 in Canterbury, Kent, England. His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine Bloom (née Copeland),\nwas born in Kolkata, India, to an English family then-resident there.\nThe man he first knew as his father, Harry Bloom, was a legendary\npolitical activist who fought for civil rights in South Africa. But\nHarry died of a stroke when Orlando was only four years old. After\nthat, Orlando and his older sister, Samantha Bloom , were raised by their\nmother and family friend, Colin Stone. When Orlando was 13, Sonia\nrevealed to him that Colin is actually the biological father of Orlando and his sister; the two were conceived after an agreement by his parents, since Harry, who suffered a stroke in 1975, was unable to have children. Orlando attended St. Edmund's School in Canterbury but struggled in many\ncourses because of dyslexia. He did embrace the arts, however, and\nenjoyed pottery, photography and sculpturing. He also participated in\nschool plays and was active at his local theater. As a teen, Orlando\nlanded his first job: he was a clay trapper at a pigeon shooting range.\nEncouraged by his mother, he and his sister began studying poetry and\nprose, eventually giving readings at Kent Festival. Orlando and\nSamantha won many poetry and Bible reciting competitions. Then Orlando,\nwho always idolized larger-than-life characters, gravitated towards\nserious acting. At the age of 16, he moved to London and joined the\nNational Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and gaining a\nscholarship to train with the British American Drama Academy. Like many\nyoung actors, he also auditioned for a number of television roles to\nfurther his career, landing bit parts in British television shows Casualty (1986) , Midsomer Murders (1997) and Smack the Pony (1999) .

As fate would have it,\nseated in the audience one night in 1999 was a director named Peter Jackson . After the show, he\nmet with Orlando and asked him to audition for his new set of movies.\nAfter graduating from Guildhall, Orlando began work on the \"Lord of the\nRings\" trilogy, spending 18 months in New Zealand bringing to life\n\"Legolas\", a part which made him a household name.

After leaving school and having many odd jobs, he ended up in a band with Geezer Butler . This group then split, leading Ozzy and Geezer to join Tony Iommi and Bill Ward in a new band that went under several names (including Earth) that ended up being called Black Sabbath after a song of the same name that appeared on their first album (released 1969/70). He recorded several more albums with Sabbath despite the decline of his relationship with Tony Iommi, which after several break ups led to him leaving/being fired from the band in 1979. After a short time he launched a solo career with a line up behind him that varied immensely from album to album and tour to tour. During the '80s, he was treated several times for alcoholism and was sued twice for the suicides of some of his young fans (cleared completely). Following his No More Tears album he declared he would tour for the last time, though the band later inevitably reunited. Ozzy gained a new generation of fans with his role, as himself, on the reality show The Osbournes (2002) , and continued performing, solo and with his band, until the month of his death in July 2025. - IMDb mini biography by: Mark Oliver",

The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King were nominated for and collected a slew of awards from around the globe, with The Return of the King receiving his most impressive collection of awards. This included three Academy Awards® (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture), two Golden Globes (Best Director and Best Motion Picture-Drama), three BAFTAs (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film and Viewers' Choice), a Directors Guild Award, a Producers Guild Award and a New York Film Critics Circle Award. As a follow up to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, in 2005, Jackson directed, wrote, and produced King Kong, for Universal Pictures. The film grossed over $500 million and won three Oscars®. Jackson previously received widespread acclaim for his 1994 feature Heavenly Creatures, which received an Academy Award® nomination for Best Screenplay. Other film credits include The Frighteners, starring Michael J. Fox; the adult puppet feature Meet the Feebles; and Braindead, which won 16 international science fiction awards, including the Saturn. Jackson also co-directed the television documentary Forgotten Silver, which also hit the film festival circuit. Jackson directed the Academy Award®-nominated The Lovely Bones, an adaptation of the acclaimed best-selling novel by Alice Sebold and produced the worldwide sci-fi hit District 9. He was a producer on Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn in 2011, with two more films set to come out in the future. His most recent films include producer of 2018's action film Mortal Engines, based on a post-apocalyptic world where cities ride on wheels and consume each other to survive. Following Mortal Engines, he produced They Shall Not Grow Old, a documentary on World War I with never-before-seen footage. BAFTA nominated the film for Best Documentary, and it won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing from the Motion Picture Sound Editors. Jackson's next project is the music documentary The Beatles: Get Back, which he directed and produced, due to be released August, 2021. Jackson works closely with partner Dame Fran Walsh, with whom he shares his writing and producing credits, as well as a family.

Masterston complained that\nReynolds, then in full-superstar status, had tinkered with the\ncharacter and dialog of the sheriff to make him more like Reynolds' own\npersona, thus fatally flawing the film. Before hitting it big with \"Whorehouse\", Masterston had an\nunspectacular career as an actor beginning in the mid-1960s and\ncontinuing through the mid-'80s, when he shifted his attentions towards\ndirecting with The Trip to Bountiful (1985) .\nThe film, which was adapted by Masterston's cousin Horton Foote from Foote's own play, was a\nsuccess, earning Geraldine Page the\nAcademy Award as Best Actress. - IMDb mini biography by: Jon C.

      "biography": "In 2006 R.J. Mitte moved to Hollywood, California, with his family to\nsupport the foray of his sister, actress Lacianne Carriere, into print\nand commercial work. For fun, Mitte began training with Los Angeles\ntalent manager Addison K. Witt in Sherman Oaks, Cal. And though many of\nthe actors in the studio were working actors, Mitte was using acting as\na means to build friendship with kids his own age while living in a new\ncity. At the encouragement of Witt and talent agent Debra Manners of\nthe Daniel Hoff Agency, Mitte began auditioning for commercials and TV\nshows like Grey's Anatomy (2005) . Mitte tried his hand at background roles and became a regular student on the popular Disney show Hannah Montana (2006) , later being romantically linked to the show's iconic star, Miley Cyrus . Mitte was cast as Walt White Jr., a series regular, and character with\ncerebral palsy on AMC Network's Breaking Bad (2008) . And though Mitte has a\nmild case of the same condition, he had to do what all actors do: research\nthe character and even relearn many of the challenges he had endured as\na child in order to convey a more pronounced version of CP. The Daily\nAdvertiser, a Lafayette, La., newspaper learned of Mitte's work in\nHollywood and featured him in an article, noting that R.J. was\nhomegrown, and off to a great start in Hollywood. - IMDb mini biography by: WEMedia Best known as Walter \"Flynn\" White Jr for five riveting seasons of AMC's Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning dramatic thriller \"Breaking Bad,\" Mitte, reemerged this year on the big screen in \"Dixieland,\" which premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival, portraying the deceptive CJ, in his first non-handicapped leading role. Up next he will be starring in the upcoming independent film \"Triumph\" currently shooting in Nashville, TN. Playing a determined high school senior with ambitions of making the wrestling team despite suffering from cerebral palsy. Following his \"Breaking Bad\" success RJ was thrust into the global spotlight as the celebrity face and model of GAP International's 2014 \"Lived in Spring\" campaign. With his image appearing on mediums such as billboards, buses, and life-sized posters in cities across the world from Tokyo to Dubai and across the US, he has cemented himself as a face to know in the fashion world. In 2015 he was found walking in Men's Fashion Week in Milan, Berlin and New York City for Vivienne Westwood, soPopular, Julian Zigerli and Ovadia & Sons. After RJ's appearance in the Vivienne Westwood show with a black and white breast place for Milan fashion week, the entire fashion and entertainment industry went mad for RJ. He was called by Dazed and Confused Magazine, \"an overnight Fashion sensation.\" During its fifth and final season, the \"Breaking Bad\" premiere drew approximately 5.9 million viewers, a number that nearly doubled to 10.3 million by the season's final episode. As Walt Jr.,also referred to by fans as \"The Breakfast King,\" Mitte acted as the Cerebral Palsy-afflicted son of Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Skyler (Anna Gunn). As Walter continued his descent into drug manufacturing and trade, Walt Jr. finds himself torn between his father's deceit, his mother's protectiveness, and his own developing sense of independence. Walter Jr.'s Cerebral Palsy on the show was embellished, meaning RJ had to learn how to walk on crutches and slur his speech to create a more dramatic version of his own disability. At the young age of three, Louisiana native Mitte was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, though that has never deterred his drive to succeed in television, film & fashion. After moving to Los Angeles due to his sister's chance encounter with a casting director, Mitte landed roles in various shows such as Showtime's \"Weeds,\" NBC's \"Vegas,\" and CW's \"Everybody Hates Chris\" until being cast in his life-changing role on \"Breaking Bad.\" In addition, Mitte currently guest stars on ABC Family's prime time hit show \"Switched at Birth\" as Campbell, the love interest of Daphne, a girl whose being switched at birth and subsequently reunited with her biological family becomes a major source of tension in her personal and romantic life. Throughout the years, Mitte has been an inspiration to his peers around the world by championing over his Cerebral Palsy in hopes of removing the stigma associated with disabilities. In order to bring awareness to his own issues with bullying and prejudice, Mitte has engaged in public speaking and serves as the official Ambassador for United Cerebral Palsy and Shriners Hospitals for Children and is the celebrity face for the #CutTheBull campaign launched in October 2014 in support of children with disabilities, much like himself and was a featured panelist at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival discussing diversity. He's also involved with SAG-AFTRA as a member of the union's Performers with Disabilities Committee.",

      "biography": "Described by film producer Michael Deeley as \"the very best eye in the business\", director Ridley Scott was born on November 30, 1937 in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the British Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London's Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department. In 1962, he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director's course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police series Z Cars (1962) , Error of Judgement (1965) . More TV work followed until, frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC, he went into advertising. With his younger brother, Tony Scott , he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television, including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak's New World Symphony which are still talked about today (\"'e were a great baker were our dad.\") He began working with producer David Puttnam in the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor, The Duellists (1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d'Or, more than successfully launching Scott's feature film career. The success of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) inspired Scott's interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O'Bannon 's low budget science fiction horror movie Alien (1979) , a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director. Blade Runner (1982) followed in 1982 to, at best, a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed, its reputation grew - and Scott's with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott's next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his \"1984\"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22, 1984. Scott's movie career has seen a few flops (notably Legend (1985) and 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) ), but with successes like Thelma & Louise (1991) , Gladiator (2000) and Black Hawk Down (2001) to offset them, his reputation remains solidly intact. Ridley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen's New Year Honours for his \"substantial contribution to the British film industry\". On July 3, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018. BAFTA described him as \"a visionary director, one of the great British film-makers whose work has made an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Forty years since his directorial debut, his films continue to cross the boundaries of style and genre, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of film talent.\" - IMDb mini biography by: Pedro Borges He was born in South Shields, North East England and raised in London ,Cumbria, Wales and Germany then returned to North East England to live in Stockton on Tees. He studied at the West Hartlepool College of Art where he studied graphic design and painting, He also studied at the Royal Academy of Art where he made his first short film 'Boy and a Bicycle which starred his brother Tony, Graduating with honors he was awarded a travelling scholarship to America for a year. During that time he was employed by Time Life Inc, where he worked with the award winning documentarians Richard Leacock and D A Pennebaker. Returning to Britain he joined the BBC as a production designer and within a year was promoted to their directing team.\nHe made his directing debut with The Duelists which brought him the Grand Jury Prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. His 2nd film was Alien which won an Oscar for Special Effects and was followed by Blade Runner, now considered one of the landmark science fiction films of all time. In 1992 he received his first Oscar nomination and a BAFTA nomination for Best Director for Thelma and Louise which was also nominated for Best Picture Oscar and a BAFTA.\nRidley also executive produced the Emmy nominated and Golden Globe Award winning HBO feature RKO 281 In 1995 he and his brother Tony formed Scott Free Entertainment, a film and television production company which since its inception Ridley has directed such films as White Squall, and G.I.

      "biography": "Sean Bean's career since the eighties spans theatre, radio, television and movies. Bean was born in Handsworth, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, to\nRita (Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He worked for his father's welding firm before he decided to become an actor. He attended RADA in London and appeared in a number of West End stage productions including RSC's \"Fair Maid of the West\" (Spencer), (1986) and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1987) (Romeo) , as well as \"Deathwatch\" (Lederer) (1985) at the Young Vic and \"Killing the Cat\" (Danny) (1990) at the Theatre Upstairs. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villains, as in Clarissa (1991) ,\npassionate lovers like Mellors in Lady Chatterley (1993) , rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heart wrenching\nwarriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in Troy (2004) , where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie. Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glitzy world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. Bean has three daughters, Lorna, Molly and Evie. - IMDb mini biography by: Winona Kent and moviefarie",

      "biography": "One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best known\ndirector and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975) , and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else. Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg , an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped\nout to pursue his entertainment career.\nAmong his\nearly directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World\nWar II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes\nyou believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961) , which\nfeatured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg , and The Last Gun (1959) , a western.\nAll of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg\ndirected a couple of movies that would portend his future career in\nmovies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964) , a movie about aliens\ninvading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967) , which was\nunfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin' (1968) , which featured the desert\nprominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would\nfeature. Amblin' also became the name of his production\ncompany, which turned out such classics as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) .\nSpielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duel (1971) , with Dennis Weaver . In the early 1970s,\nSpielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling 's Night Gallery (1969) , Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969) and Murder by the Book (1971) .\nAll of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing\nprojects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would\ndazzle audiences all over the world. Spielberg's first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974) ,\nwith Goldie Hawn , a film that marked him as\na rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an\ninternational superstar among directors: Jaws (1975) . This classic shark attack tale\nstarted the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was\ncredited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) ,\na unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978,\nSpielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) ,\nand followed that effort with Used Cars (1980) , a critically\nacclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell / Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more\ntime with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) ,\nwith Harrison Ford taking the part\nof Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982.\nThe first was Poltergeist (1982) , but\nthe highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien\nstory E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) .\nSpielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The\nconcept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when\nSpielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or\ninfamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one\nof the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\"\nand \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects\nwas placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg\nfollowed up \"Raiders\" with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) ,\nwhich was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim\nof its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in\nthe 1980s, such as The Goonies (1985) , and was the\nbrains behind the little monsters in Gremlins (1984) . He also produced the\ncartoon An American Tail (1986) , a\nquaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,\nhowever, was the blockbuster Back to the Future (1985) ,\nwhich made Michael J. Fox an\ninstant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book The Color Purple (1985) , with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey , with great success. In the\nlatter half of the 1980s, he also directed Empire of the Sun (1987) , a\nmixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not\nescape him for long, though. The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture\nyet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) .\nThe next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he\nproduced and directed Always (1989) as\nwell as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) ,\nand Back to the Future Part II (1989) .\nAll three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in\n1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989) , with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson , which got mostly mixed results.\nSpielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong\nvoice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Adventures (1990) , Animaniacs (1993) , Pinky and the Brain (1995) , Freakazoid! (1995) , Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998) , Family Dog (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998) . Spielberg\nalso produced other cartoons such as The Land Before Time (1988) , We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993) , Casper (1995) (the live action version) as\nwell as the live-action version of The Flintstones (1994) , where\nhe was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many\nRoger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs\nand Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s,\nas he directed Hook (1991) and produced such\nfilms as the cute fantasy Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991) .\nHe also produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990) , Back to the Future Part III (1990) and Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) .\nWhile these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not\nquite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous\nefforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park (1993) , which for a\nshort time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time,\nbut did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big\nbox-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced\nand directed Schindler's List (1993) , a\nstirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars,\nand also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the\nproduction company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many\nbox-office successes. As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such\nfilms as The Mask of Zorro (1998) , Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998) . However, it was\non the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and\nproduced the epic Amistad (1997) , a\nspectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to\nthe fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997.\nThe next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best\nfilms of his career: Saving Private Ryan (1998) , a\nfilm about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect.\nIt was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998) . Spielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001) , The Haunting (1999) and Shrek (2001) . he also produced two sequels\nto Jurassic Park (1993) , which were\nfinancially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he\nproduced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a\nfinancial and critical success: Band of Brothers (2001) , a\ntale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the\ninvasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was\nback in the director's chair for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) ,\na movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box\noffice and garnered varied reviews from critics. Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other\nthings he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993) , an\nanthology series entitled Amazing Stories (1985) ,\ncreated the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War\nTwo, and was a starting producer of ER (1994) . Spielberg, if you haven't\nnoticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000) , a\ndocumentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a\ndocumentary about the Holocaust called Eyes of the Holocaust (2000) .\nWith all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked\nat as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment. - IMDb mini biography by: Scott msa0510@mail.ecu.edu",

      "biography": "Near the top of the A-list of Hollywood screenwriters, Steven Zaillian has proved himself to be a capable writer and director. The California native began his career as an editor, cutting films like \"Breaker, Breaker\" (1976), \"Kingdom of the Spiders\" (1977), \"Starhops\" (1978) and \"Below the Belt\" (1980), it would be years before Zaillian would have his first produced script with 1985's \"The Falcon and the Snowman\". Zaillian followed up with the Penny Marshall-directed \"Awakenings\" (1990), which netted him a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination. At the behest of producer Scott Rudin, he made his directorial debut with \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" (1993). Despite its enthusiastic reception by critics, the film, along with another Zaillian-scripted drama \"Jack the Bear\" (1993), failed at the box office. But it was the success of Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" (1993) that brought him an Oscar for his screenplay (adapted from Thomas Keneally's book) about the morally ambiguous German businessman who saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust. Zaillian went mainstream with his next two projects, \"Clear and Present Danger\" (1994), and providing the story for \"Mission: Impossible\" (1996). After working as a script doctor on a few films, Zaillian returned behind the camera to helm \"A Civil Action\" (1998), a drama which opened to mostly favorable reviews. - IMDb mini biography by: P.H.

      "biography": "Thomas Keneally, (born October 7, 1935, Sydney, Australia), Australian writer best known for his historical novels. Keneally's characters are gripped by their historical and personal past, and decent individuals are portrayed at odds with systems of authority. At age 17 Keneally entered a Roman Catholic seminary, but he left before ordination; the experience influenced his early fiction, including The Place at Whitton (1964) and Three Cheers for the Paraclete (1968). His reputation as a historical novelist was established with Bring Larks and Heroes (1967), about Australia's early years as an English penal colony. The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1972; film 1980) won Keneally international acclaim; it is based on the actual story of a half-caste Aboriginal who rebels against white racism by going on a murder spree. The Great Shame (1998), a work inspired by his own ancestry, details 80 years of Irish history from the perspective of Irish convicts sent to Australia in the 19th century. Although Australia figures prominently in much of Keneally's work, his range is broad. His well-received Gossip from the Forest (1975) examines the World War I armistice through the eyes of a thoughtful, humane German negotiator. He is also praised for his treatment of the American Civil War in Confederates (1979). His later fiction includes A Family Madness (1985), To Asmara (1989), Flying Hero Class (1991), Woman of the Inner Sea (1992), Jacko (1993), Homebush Boy (1995), Bettany's Book (2000), The Tyrant's Novel (2003), The Widow and Her Hero (2007), and The Daughters of Mars (2012). Keneally's best-known work, Schindler's Ark (1982; also published as Schindler's List; film 1993), tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. Like many of Keneally's protagonists, Schindler is a rather ordinary man who acts in accord with his conscience despite the evil around him. The book won him the Man Booker Prize and he also worked with Steven Spielberg on the original drafts of the Schindler's List screenplay which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Adapated Screenplay. He was shortlisted on three further occasions for the Man Booker prize - IMDb mini biography by: Paul G Andrews",

      "biography": "A familiar patrician-looking face both here and abroad, blue-eyed, fair-haired classical stage and TV actor Tim Pigott-Smith, the son of a journalist, was born on in Rugby, Warwickshire, on May 13, 1946. The Britisher attended King Edward VI School in Stratford-upon-Avon, graduated from Bristol University in 1967, and then receiving his acting training at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. In later years, he would return to Bristol University as a lecturer. Tim made his professional debut in 1969 with the Bristol Old Vic under the stage name of \"Tim Smith\" and was predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory companies. He focused quite strongly on Shakespeare and Greek plays and went on to play Balthazar in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" for the Prospect touring company as well as Posthumus in a 1974 production of \"Cymbeline\" for the Royal Shakespeare Company. He made his Broadway debut that same year in \"Sherlock Holmes\" as Dr. Watson opposite John Wood . Over the years, he would act alongside most of England's grande dame royalty including Judi Dench , Helen Mirren , Geraldine James , Margaret Tyzack , Peggy Ashcroft , Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton . A charming, distinguished presence on stage, Tim was invited by an ailing Anthony Quayle to take over the running of the Compass theatre company founded by him in 1984 and served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. A theatre director as well (\"Hamlet,\" and \"A Royal Hunt of the Sun\"), he would take several Shakespearean classics later to BBC-TV. He, in fact, started his small screen career in secondary Shakespeare roles as Laertes in Hamlet (1970) opposite Ian McKellen in the title role and Proculeius in Antony and Cleopatra (1974) starring Richard Johnson and Janet Suzman . He transitioned into more prominent BBC roles with his Angelo in Measure for Measure (1979) and Hotspur in Henry IV Part I (1979) . Aside from Tim's theatre work, quality TV remained an extremely successful venue for decades with impressive performances in such prestigious min-series as North & South (1975) , The Glittering Prizes (1976) , The Lost Boys (1978) , Danger UXB (1979) , Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981) , Fame Is the Spur (1982) , I Remember Nelson (1982) , The Jewel in the Crown (1984) (BAFTA-TV as sadistic villain Ronald Merrick) and The Challenge (1986) . He enjoyed recurring roles on the TV series Doctor Who (1963) , Hannah (1980) and regular roles in the short-lived comedy Struggle (1983) , the drama The Chief (1990) and with The Vice (1999) . His mellifluous voice was also popular on many BBC radio productions, in audio books, as well as serving as a narrator on such documentary series as Crimes That Shook the World (2006) and Doomsday: World War I (2013) Film work began in the 1970's but remained far and few and less distinguished with his minor participation in Aces High (1976) , Joseph Andrews (1977) , Sweet William (1980) , Clash of the Titans (1981) , Richard's Things (1980) , Victory (1981) and The Remains of the Day (1993) . He did enjoy a prime role in the nuclear drama A State of Emergency (1986) starring opposite Martin Sheen and Peter Firth . Pigott-Smith remained a strong, vibrant present on the stage throughout his career. In later years, he played in such contemporary plays as \"Benefactors\" (1984), \"Coming in to Land\" (1987) opposite Ms. Smith and \"Amadeus\" as composer Salieri. He also portrayed Leontes in \"The Winter's Tale\" (1988) and scored critical acclaim in the 1999 version of \"The Iceman Cometh\" (both London and Broadway) and with Ms. Mirren in an over four-hour production of \"Mourning Becomes Electra.\" Into the millennium, he was seen in \"Julius Caesar\" (as Cassius, 2001), \"A Christmas Carol\" (as Scrooge, 2002), \"Women Beware Women\" (2006), \"Enron\" (2009), \"Educating Rita\" (2010), \"A Delicate Balance\" (2011), \"King Lear\" (title role, 2011), \"The Tempest\" (as Prospero, 2012), the Chorus in \"Henry V\" in 2013, and earned both Olivier and Tony nominations here and abroad for his powerful portrayal of King Charles III (2015). Tim became an RSC Associate Artist in 2012, and served on both the RSC board (from 2005 until 2011) and as a governor from 2005 until his retirement in 2016. On film in later years, he often appeared in official high-ranking parts. His list of movies include Martin Scorsese 's Gangs of New York (2002) , The Four Feathers (2002) , the historical Greek biopic Alexander (2004) starring Colin Farrell , V for Vendetta (2005) , Flyboys (2006) , Quantum of Solace (2008) , Alice in Wonderland (2010) , RED 2 (2013) , Jupiter Ascending (2015) and Whisky Galore (2016) . He also graced such TV shows as \"Downtown Abbey\" and recreated his stage triumph in the title role of King Charles III (2017) which earned him a second BAFTA-TV nomination. Tim was in rehearsals for an upcoming stage performance of \"Death of a Salesman\" as Willy Loman in London when he died suddenly of natural causes on April 7, 2017, at age 70. He was survived by his actress wife Pamela Miles and their son Tom Pigott-Smith , a concert/studio violinist. - IMDb mini biography by: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net",

      "biography": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. Ron Howard was working on Splash (1984) , a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy . Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987) , Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992) . Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993) . The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay. Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995) , as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer. As of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and has remained active in the film industry for more than four decades. - IMDb mini biography by: Pedro Borges",

      "biography": "Tom Sizemore rose in prominence throughout the 1990s, establishing\nhimself as a memorable tough-guy actor, sought by the most respected\ndirectors in the business. Thomas Edward Sizemore, Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Judith\n(Schannault), an ombudsman staff member, and Thomas Edward Sizemore,\nSr., a lawyer and professor. Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy\ncharacters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State\nUniversity, he got his master's degree in theatre from Temple\nUniversity in 1986. Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and\nperforming in plays. His first break came when Oliver Stone cast him in a bit part\nin Born on the Fourth of July (1989) .\nBigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as Guilty by Suspicion (1991) , True Romance (1993) , and Striking Distance (1993) . 1994\nproved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of\n\"Bat Masterson\" in Kevin Costner 's\nstar-studded biopic Wyatt Earp (1994) ,\nas well as one of his first truly memorable roles as \"Detective Jack\nScagnetti\" in Oliver Stone 's\ncontroversial Natural Born Killers (1994) .\nIn 1995 he appeared in Devil in a Blue Dress (1995) , Strange Days (1995) , as well as the\nacclaimed crime epic Heat (1995) , directed\nby Michael Mann . Sizemore's first\nbig leading role is in The Relic (1997) , the big-budget\neffects thriller directed by Peter Hyams . According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a\ndrug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend Robert De Niro appeared on his door-step\nduring the filming of Witness to the Mob (1998) .\nTelling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation,\nSizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he\ncounseled adolescents involved in substance abuse. Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both Terrence Malick and Steven Spielberg , Sizemore chose the\nrole of \"Sergeant Horvath\" in Saving Private Ryan (1998) .\nThe role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore's\ntalents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded\nrole than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this\nshoot and Steven Spielberg for helping\nhim with his recovery from addiction, with Steven Spielberg threatening to re-shoot\nthe entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once. After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in Enemy of the State (1998) ,\nSizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead (1999) directed by Martin Scorsese . Seemingly\ntaking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances\nin Play It to the Bone (1999) , Red Planet (2000) , and Pearl Harbor (2001) . Sizemore then\nreceived another leading role in the high-profile military drama Black Hawk Down (2001) directed\nby yet another legendary director, Ridley Scott . Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that\nhearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continued to be a\nfavorite of Hollywood's greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his\nmind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of\npretension was refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film,\nSizemore looked to continue as one of Hollywood's greatest actors,\nuntil his untimely death from a brain aneurysm on March 3, 2023. - IMDb mini biography by: Brian Stewart",

Several other film roles quickly followed, before he landed the plum role of Capt. Dallas of the ill-fated commercial towing vehicle Nostromo in the creepy sci-fi epic Alien (1979) . Skerritt turned up again in another thriller playing a cop hunting a serial killer in the eerie The Dead Zone (1983) , as a Navy Officer Flight instructor in Top Gun (1986) , in the six-chick flick Steel Magnolias (1989) , and then as the poster boy for a \"Guess\" Jeans ad campaign utilizing his mature, weather-beaten features. Skerritt didn't neglect his TV background and reappeared on the small screen in Cheers (1982) , The China Lake Murders (1990) and picked up an Emmy in 1994 for his performance as Sheriff Brock in the superb series Picket Fences (1992) . Skerritt has remained continually busy for the past decade, contributing natural, entertaining and reliable performances in TV series, made-for-TV movies and major theatrical releases. He recreated the role of Will Kane in the TV production of High Noon (2000) , and appeared alongside Bruce Willis in the mercenary war drama Tears of the Sun (2003) . - IMDb mini biography by: firehouse44",

      "biography": "Since his screen debut as a young Amish farmer in Peter Weir 's Witness (1985) , Viggo Mortensen's career has been marked by a steady string of well-rounded performances. Mortensen was born in New York City, to Grace Gamble (Atkinson) and Viggo Peter Mortensen, Sr. His father was Danish, his mother was American, and his maternal grandfather was Canadian. His parents met in Norway. They wed and moved to New York, where Viggo, Jr. was born, before moving to South America, where Viggo, Sr. managed chicken farms and ranches in Venezuela and Argentina. Two more sons were born, Charles and Walter, before the marriage grew increasingly unhappy. When Viggo was seven, his parents sent him to the St. Paul's boarding school, in the Córdoba Sierras, in Argentina. Then, at age eleven, his parents divorced. His mother moved herself and the children back to her home state of New York. Viggo attended Watertown High School, and became a very good student and athlete. He graduated in 1976 and went on to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. After graduation, he moved to Denmark - driven by the need for a defining purpose in life. He began writing poetry and short stories while working many odd jobs, from dock worker to flower seller. In 1982, he fell in love and followed his girlfriend back to New York City, hoping for a long romance and a writing career. He got neither. In New York, Viggo found work waiting tables and tending bar and began taking acting classes, studying with Warren Robertson . He appeared in several plays and movies, and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where his performance in \"Bent\" at the Coast Playhouse earned him a Drama-logue Critic's Award. He made his film debut with a small part in Witness (1985) . He appeared in Salvation! (1987) and married his co-star, Exene Cervenka . The two had a son, Henry Mortensen . But after nearly eleven years of marriage, the couple divorced. In 1999, Viggo got a phone call about a movie he did not know anything about: \"The Lord of the Rings.\" At first, he didn't want to do it, because it would mean time away from his son. But Henry, a big fan of the books, told his father he shouldn't turn down the role. Viggo accepted the part and immediately began work on the project, which was already underway. Eventually, the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\" made him a household name - a difficult consequence for the ever private and introspective Viggo. Critics have continually recognized his work in over thirty movies, including such diverse projects as Jane Campion 's The Portrait of a Lady (1996) , Sean Penn 's The Indian Runner (1991) , Brian De Palma 's Carlito's Way (1993) , Ridley Scott 's G.I. Jane (1997) , Tony Scott 's Crimson Tide (1995) , Andrew Davis 's A Perfect Murder (1998) , Ray Loriga 's My Brother's Gun (1997) , Tony Goldwyn 's A Walk on the Moon (1999) , and Peter Farrelly 's Green Book (2018) . Mortensen is also an accomplished poet, photographer and painter. - IMDb mini biography by: Grace Z and J.W. Braun, Alvar H.G.",

      "biography": "Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair in Alameda County, California, along with his fraternal twin brother, Paul Vincent . He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\". His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel. Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995) , which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception. Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997) . Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Saving Private Ryan (1998) . Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of The Iron Giant (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black (2000) . The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves. Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001) , xXx (2002) , The Pacifier (2005) , Fast & Furious (2009) , Fast Five (2011) , Fast & Furious 6 (2013) , and Furious 7 (2015) . He also voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama Find Me Guilty (2006) , the latter directed by Sidney Lumet . - IMDb mini biography by: Lilith <webmistress@vindiesel.co.uk>",

      "biography": "George Vincent Gilligan Jr. (born February 10, 1967) is an American writer, producer, and director. He is known for his television work, specifically as creator, head writer, executive producer, and director of Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul. He was a writer and producer for The X-Files and was the co-creator of its spin-off The Lone Gunmen. Both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul have received widespread critical acclaim, with Gilligan winning two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Writers Guild of America Awards, two Critics' Choice Television Awards and Producers Guild of America Awards, one Directors Guild of America Award and a BAFTA. Outside of television, he co-wrote the screenplay for the 2008 film Hancock. Gilligan was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Gail, a grade school teacher, and George Vincent Gilligan Sr., an insurance claims adjuster. His parents divorced in 1974 and he and his younger brother, Patrick, were raised in Farmville and Chesterfield County, and attended the laboratory school run by Longwood College. Growing up, Gilligan became best friends with future film editor and film title designer Angus Wall. His interest in film began when Wall's mother, Jackie, who also taught alongside Gilligan's mother, would lend her Super 8 film cameras to him. He used the camera to make science fiction films with Patrick. One of his first films was entitled Space Wreck, starring his brother in the lead role. One year later, he won first prize for his age group in a film competition at the University of Virginia. Jackie would take Wall and Gilligan to Richmond and drop them off at Cloverleaf Mall to see films, and encourage both of them to pursue a career in the arts. \"I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for Jackie. She was a wonderful lady and a real inspiration,\" he recalls. Gilligan was recognized for his talents and creativity at an early age. George Sr. described him as a \"kind of a studious-type young man, and he liked to read, and he had a vivid imagination\". He introduced Gilligan to film noir classics, as well as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood Westerns on late-night television. Gilligan won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts. After eighth grade, he moved back to Chesterfield to attend high school. After graduating from Lloyd C. Bird High School in 1985, Gilligan went on to attend NYU's Tisch School of the Arts on a scholarship, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film production. While at NYU, he wrote the screenplay for Home Fries; Gilligan received the Virginia Governor's Screenwriting Award in 1989 for the screenplay, which was later turned into a film. One of the judges of the competition was Mark Johnson, a film producer. He was impressed by Gilligan, saying he \"was the most imaginative writer I'd ever read\". - IMDb mini biography by: ahmetkozan",

      "biography": "Whoopi Goldberg was born Caryn Elaine Johnson in the Chelsea section of Manhattan on November 13, 1955. Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. Goldberg came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley . She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella . Goldberg was married three times and was once addicted to drugs. Goldberg had her first big film starring role in The Color Purple (1985) . She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like Burglar (1987) , The Telephone (1988) and Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986) . She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost (1990) . Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) . She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". Goldberg received another smash hit role in Sister Act (1992) . Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and\nit was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Made in America (1993) and Soapdish (1991) . Goldberg followed up to her success with Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993) , which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first. As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie (1996) and The Associate (1996) , and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) and How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998) . Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include Rat Race (2001) and the quietly received Kingdom Come (2001) . Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including The Pagemaster (1994) and Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990) , as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including Theodore Rex (1995) ). Whoopi is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Whoopi is also the center square in Hollywood Squares (1998) , sometimes hosts the Academy Awards, and is an author, with the book \"Book.\" - IMDb mini biography by: Scott msa0510@mail.ecu.edu",

      "biography": "Physically imposing, intense Yaphet Kotto was one of the few actors of his generation to succeed in breaking racial stereotypes in Hollywood. He was born in Harlem, New York, the son of Gladys, a nurse and army officer, and Abraham Kotto, a businessman-turned-construction worker. His father was a Cameroonian immigrant, of royal ancestry (his great-grandfather had been a king in pre-colonial days), and his mother's family was from Antigua and Panama. Yaphet, whose first name means \"beautiful\" in Hebrew, was raised in the Jewish faith. After his parents divorced, he was brought up by his grandparents in the tough Bronx district of New York. He also had an aunt in showbiz who ran a dance academy. Among her alumni were Marlon Brando and James Dean . In fact, it was Brando's performance in On the Waterfront (1954) which inspired Kotto to go into acting. He began acting on stage in 1958 with little theatrical experience, making his debut in the title role of Othello, a role he eventually reprised on screen in 1980. He also appeared on Broadway as understudy to James Earl Jones in The Great White Hope. After joining the Actor's Studio, Kotto commenced his screen career and soon gathered critical recognition with several edgy performances across diverse genres. From playing a barkeeper in 5 Card Stud (1968) and a thief in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) , he moved on to juicier supporting roles as the evil Kananga/Mr. Big in the James Bond thriller Live and Let Die (1973) , Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the telemovie Raid on Entebbe (1976) and the ill-fated Nostromo engineer Parker in Alien (1979) . Kotto also starred as a street-smart Detroit car worker in Blue Collar (1978) and had a recurring role as a senior detective on television's long-running crime series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) (in addition to penning several scripts for the show). He was even on a Paramount shortlist for the coveted role of Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) , alongside Mitchell Ryan and Roy Thinnes ). He apparently spurned the role for fear of being typecast, but came to rueing that decision in later years. For the same reason Kotto had also turned down the part of Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars franchise (which went to Billy Dee Williams ). Kotto died on March 15 2021 in Manila, Phillipines at the age of 81. - IMDb mini biography by: I.S.Mowis",
